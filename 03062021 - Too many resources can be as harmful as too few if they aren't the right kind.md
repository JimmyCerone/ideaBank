## Context
- I came across this idea while reading about the [[The Wright Brothers by David]]. Their competition, Samuel Langley, had millions from the Smithsonian and failed. 

## Idea
- The Wright brothers figured out the right #Levers to pull on, namely flight time. Langley barely ever spent any time in flight (none himself) and was too theoretical, not enough of an #Empiricism. 
- This idea is tackled in [[Range]] as well when they talk about the limits of #Expert s in [[03062021 - There are wicked and kind learning environments]].

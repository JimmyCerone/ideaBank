## Context
- [[The Wright Brothers by David]] made their planes out of sheer #Curious nature. Yet it was used badly.

## Idea
- The #Flight that the brothers made possible was used in world #War II in horrible ways. As HG Wells predicted ([[03072021 - The future is predicted and shaped by fiction]]) - the #Technical #Innovation was coopted for war. 

## Reflections
- Kind of naively, the wright brothers hoped the plane would bring lasting #Peace. Yet they failed to see the #Risk inherent in their #Inventions. I stand by the fact that [[03102021 - Some inventions are better left uninvented]]. I'm not sure the airplane is in this category, but I do think the argument can be made. Especially in light of the [[03102021 - The faster the speed of travel the greater the inequality in the society]]. Mixed bag, even without considering the #Environment.

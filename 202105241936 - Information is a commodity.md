## Idea
- Energy in today's world is the fundamental unit / commodity. [[Google]] and [[Amazon]] and [[Apple]] are huge because of their access to information. 

## Connections
- [[03-03-2021 - Our language creates our reality]] well so does our data, which is problematic because [[202104222236 - Machine learning is biased.]] and [[202104222140 - Data is a reflection of our history]], which is screwed up. 
- Another way to see this is that [[202104222251 - Data is currency]] these days. 

## Example
- Knowing information about foreign countries is a commodity that is traded in [[Burn Notice]]

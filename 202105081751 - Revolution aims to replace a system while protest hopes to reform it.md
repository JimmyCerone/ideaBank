## Idea
- A useful distinction I'd never considered before. I think [[Isaac Nelson]] has talked about this before, but it didn't crystallize in my head until reading [[Black Power and Black Theology by James Cone]]. 
- What I find interesting is [[Switch - How to Change Things When Change is Hard by Dan and Chip Heath]] talks about all kinds of revolutions that happen within companies by changing habits ([[The Power of Habits by Charles Duhigg]]). Is that a possible avenue for social change? 

## Example
- Protesting to change a law
- Revolution (France) to change a system

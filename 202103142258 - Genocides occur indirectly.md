## Idea
- When I picture a #Genocide, I usually think of #Nazi gas chambers and direct murder. However, while reading [[King Leopold's Ghost]], it became apparent that several [[03062021 - Levers]], many of them not murder, were used to kill people.

## Example
- In the #Congo, the #Genocide was carried out via:
	1. Murder
	2. Starvation, exhaustion, and exposure (overwork - think #Gulag)
	3. Disease (as occurred in [[The Heart of Everything That Is]])
		- In depth look at this in [[Guns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond]]. 
	4. Plummeting Birth Rate 
		- Never considered this but it makes sense given the 3 factors above.

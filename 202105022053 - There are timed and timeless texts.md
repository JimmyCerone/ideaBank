## Reflections
- Not sure how I'd splice this. I think that some people get worked up about "timeless" texts that are really stuff old and outdated. Or are stained by so many biases that they are barely useful. Stoicism in particular seems overdone and probably harmful. Yet it's true that some things are only transitory. This is part of my decision to [[Change how I handle information input]], which is ongoing, including some outreach on [[Twitter]]. Got a lot to think about here.

I'm not sure I've ever connected these two ideas, [[040720211225 - Freedom]] and justice. What's interesting is that the connections were all there I just didn't make them. In this case, we see that while [[202104120847 - Words aren't well defined]] the relationships between them can be. 

## Connections
- I wonder how to reconcile [[202104071224 - Ideological freedom finds it source in financial freedom]] with this. Is financial freedom connected to justice? I think Balaji would argue that it is in light of [[03292021 - Cancel Culture]], which he views as unjust. I view it as just though so I think this idea might actually work against justice. 
- [[202103282113 - Freedom entails responsibility]] is an interesting corollary here. Not sure if these are two different ways of saying the same thing or if they are fundamentally different.

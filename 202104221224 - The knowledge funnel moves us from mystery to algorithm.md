## Reflections
- Fascinating reflection of [[202104120847 - Words aren't well defined]] that shows the progression from mystery to algorithm. Makes me wonder how this connects to what [[Neil]] and I do as we are making lots of simple #Heuristics which could lead to #Algorithm s that we could sell. 
- [[Atomic Object]] plays in the Heuristic space because if it were an algorithm, you wouldn't need Atomic. You would shop around for the cheapest quote you can get.

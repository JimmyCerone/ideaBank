We have this weird relationship with #Gun in #America. We treat guns like they are just recreational, yet we say people can't take them away because then we can't defend ourselves. Which is it? 

What's weird about guns is that unlike most consumer products, we [[202104050849 - Offloading responsibility is manipulative]] onto consumers. If Mattel made a terrible product that hurt kids, they'd be sued. Not so for Smith & Wesson. 

What's worse is that there are lots of common sense safety features (like removing all bullets when the clip comes out) that would make guns way safer, yet people don't follow them at all.

## Context
- The first report of the [[The Wright Brothers by David]] flight was not in the Scientific American, but in the Gleanings in Bee Culture by a friend Amos Root. 

## Connections
- This seems to be a direct result of my theory that [[03062021 - Innovators often look crazy until their ideas come to fruition]] - #Innovation doesn't happen in the open. So the larger, slow moving sources often find things late. 

## Questions
- What are these sources now? Is there any way to identify them?

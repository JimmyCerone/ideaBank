Another one from [[202103291336 - The Episode of Everything - Balaji on Bitcoin]] and is deeply connected to many of my ideas about #Language:

- [[03-03-2021 - Language can be violent]]

These ideas about #Language are what make media so damn powerful. Makes me want to be more careful about what media I consume. 

One component of that is paying for media, which is something I'm considering under the theme of [[Choosing to Pay for Free Services]]. Not sure how I'd choose what to pay for, but finding [[03062021 - Small obscure journals can be a fertile source of the early jump]] would be something I'd definitely pay for.

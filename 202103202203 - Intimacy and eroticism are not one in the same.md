## Context
- I first came across this idea in [[Mating in Captivity by Esther Perelle]] and it blew my mind. In that book, Perelle points out that most people believe that if you fix a couple's emotional life, you fix their sex life. Conversely, they also believe that what is happening in the bedroom is reflective of what happens in other areas of life. Yet that is wrong. I'd never thought deeply about it, but you can have a great relationship without any attraction (friends) and you can have great attraction with no intimacy (a crush). 

## Idea
- The bedrock of this idea is that #Intimacy is #Security oriented and eroticism is rooted in the mysterious unknown. These are fundamentally different forces that are in tension. When you seek all security, you lose mystery and thus #Eroticism. When all you have is #Eroticism, you are left with the unknown, with mystery.

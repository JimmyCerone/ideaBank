## Ideas

- Focus on what you don't know (risk) more than what you do know
- Go from, "I'm right" to, "How do I know I'm right?"
- Limit risks with rules about when you will get out
	- How much risk are you willing to take? Cap it at that.
- #Levers were used in the creation of the all weather fund. 
	- Dalio identified two levers that affected markets:
		1. #Growth
		2. #Inflation
	- Then Dalio found an asset mix that would perform well when the economy
		- Growth+ Inflation-
		- Growth+ Inflation+
		- Growth- Inflation+
		- Growth- Inflation-
	- This mix of assets was resistant to #Risk and well balanced
- Making uncorrelated bets is the key to reducing risk. 
	- Lots of small bets don't help you if they are all correlated. 
	- Example was his alpha fund, which found many uncorrelated commodities so that if one dropped, the rest of the fund wasn't affected. 
	- An interesting take here is using negatively correlated assets to balance each other out. 
- There are certain types of people that perform similarly across different types of problems
	- They found that managers kept assigning detail oriented people to big picture tasks and vice versa
	- Then they started doing analysis of personality to match people to tasks
	- Then, just like their investments, they began to systematically pair people up with tasks and other people
- You are the designer manager of your life
	- What would you do if you were your own manager? What do you need to be fired from doing? What jobs would you take?
- There are 4 reactions to your weaknesses:
	1. Deny they exist
	2. Accept them and work at them to try to convert them into strengths
	3. Accept them and find ways around them
	4. Change what you are going after
	- Worst is the first. 
	- Second path is best if it works (you can't always change though)
		- Is the thing you are trying to do consistent with your nature?
	- Third path is the easiest and the most viable but least followed
	- Fourth path requires flexibility to find a new path
- Computerize your decision making
- Keep track of who is believable in a measured way
- Having Principles helps you make less #Decisions because you would have principles for most "types" of situations. 
	- This idea feels like #Levers 
- When you aren't working well with someone it can be because you're communicating and effectively or it could be because you think about things differently and so instead of bad communication being a symptom it's actually being a cause it's actually a symptom of a fundamental difference between the two of you and those are both lovers you could push on
- You can argue with someone or discuss and you should argue with people who have similar believability to you and discuss with people who have higher believability with you than you.
- People are different. Measuring those differences across time to put people in positions where they will succeed is huge! #Personality is remarkably stable
	- They use dots and believability scores + baseball cards to do this. 
- Trustworthiness can also be measured and tracked
-  When talking about reflections, forget about blame and credit and worry about accurate or in accurate
-  I think two of the #KeyIdeas from Principles are surfacing problems and believability like it trying to figure out who's believable and why it seems to be a very important question
-  #Pain + #Reflection = Progress
-  Idea Meritocracy


## Action Steps
- Write down your decisions
- Debate decision criteria, not decisions themselves


## Questions
- How can Neil and I use these principles to balance risk in our projects?
- How can I use the principles to balance risk in my own life? In my finances month to month?
- Where are his tools? How many of them are public?

## Tools
- Coach
	- Like siri but for helping out in business
	- A log of relevant principles
	- Give feedback to the coach which makes it better over time
- Issue Log	
	- Keeps track of issues
- Dot Collector
	- collects and visualizes opinions during meetings in real time
		- Give positive or negative dots to people in real time
	- If you are not in sync, gives suggestions about how to get there
- Baseball Cards
	- Presents peoples strengths and weakness with reasoning. Helps people understand who is good at what
- People profile
	- Simplified version of baseball cards
	- Work with people to assess self reflection
- Pain Button
	- Allows people to record the emotions they are feeling, then come back to reflect on it
	- Runs off pain + reflection = progress
- The Combinator 
	- Matches people to jobs by taking data from the baseball card
- Dispute Resolver
	- Provides paths for resolving disagreements in an idea meritocratic way
		- Helps identify believable people to help address the conflict. 
	- Daily Update Tool
	- Contract Tool
		- Makes sure you finish what you said you would do in a meeting
	- Process Flow Diagram
		- Shows all the roles and responsibilities and how jobs related to one another. An organizational graph. You can click on a person and see their baseball card.

## Reflections
Risk judgment ability seems to be critical in so many areas of life, from software development to #Budgeting, which seems to leave risk completely out of things. Getting really good at managing risk would be a boon. 

#UncorrelatedBets in Neil and I's project is very interesting.... I also think Atomic could do a better of this as we only have a single revenue stream. 

I think it'd be super helpful if Neil and I did our own #Personality tests to make sense of what tasks we need to do. 

Super bored by the back half of the book as it felt cliche and kind of arrogant. I also think he fails to account for different things.

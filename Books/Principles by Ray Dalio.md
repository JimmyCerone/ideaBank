## Ideas

- Focus on what you don't know (risk) more than what you do know
- Go from, "I'm right" to, "How do I know I'm right?"
- Limit risks with rules about when you will get out
	- How much risk are you willing to take? Cap it at that.
- #Levers were used in the creation of the all weather fund. 
	- Dalio identified two levers that affected markets:
		1. #Growth
		2. #Inflation
	- Then Dalio found an asset mix that would perform well when the economy
		- Growth+ Inflation-
		- Growth+ Inflation+
		- Growth- Inflation+
		- Growth- Inflation-
	- This mix of assets was resistant to #Risk and well balanced
- Making uncorrelated bets is the key to reducing risk. 
	- Lots of small bets don't help you if they are all correlated. 
	- Example was his alpha fund, which found many uncorrelated commodities so that if one dropped, the rest of the fund wasn't affected. 
	- An interesting take here is using negatively correlated assets to balance each other out. 
- There are certain types of people that perform similarly across different types of problems
	- They found that managers kept assigning detail oriented people to big picture tasks and vice versa
	- Then they started doing analysis of personality to match people to tasks
	- Then, just like their investments, they began to systematically pair people up with tasks and other people


## Action Steps
- Write down your decisions
- Debate decision criteria, not decisions themselves


## Questions
- How can Neil and I use these principles to balance risk in our projects?
- How can I use the principles to balance risk in my own life? In my finances month to month?

## Reflections
Risk judgment ability seems to be critical in so many areas of life, from software development to #Budgeting, which seems to leave risk completely out of things. Getting really good at managing risk would be a boon. 

#UncorrelatedBets in Neil and I's project is very interesting.... I also think Atomic could do a better of this as we only have a single revenue stream. 

I think it'd be super helpful if Neil and I did our own #Personality tests to make sense of what tasks we need to do.

The 10th book in the Wheel of Time Series

## Reflections
- There is so much #Politics in this book. Wild. 
- Fascinating to see the interactions of different #Cultures 
- There is an odd mix of #ToxicMasculinity and not... The author seems to weave between progressive and traditional without rhyme or reason. It's hard to tell if he's making a commentary or not.

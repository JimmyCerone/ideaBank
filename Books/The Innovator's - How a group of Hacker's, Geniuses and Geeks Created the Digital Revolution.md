## Reflections
- Fascinating that the first #Computer s were #Analog instead of #Digital. I had never even conceived of such a thing. 
	- Lord Kelvin and his brother were some of the pioneers in analog computers as well as this dude at MIT, Bush. 

## Ideas
- Four principles that drove the computer age:
	1. Digital 
		- Analog computers were some of the first but the advantages of Digital were the more developed theoretical concepts surrounding it (like Logic Theory)
	2. Binary
		- I think that Claude Shannon came up with this while at Bell Labs - see [[The Idea Factory]] for more details. Leibniz was critical here as well. 
	3. Electronic
		- The move from relays (first used at AT&T for the phone lines) to transistors gave computers their speed advantage
	4. General Purpose
		- Lady Lovelace was one of the first to see the need for this. Reminds me of [[Superintelligence]] as the next step seems to be General Intelligence, not general purpose. Or perhaps its an extension of general purpose.

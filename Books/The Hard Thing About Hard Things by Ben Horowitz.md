## Ideas
- #Markets aren't good at finding the best conclusions, but are instead very good at converging upon _a_ conclusion. #Capitalism
- The best leaders are good at picking the best among a terrible group of options
	- This is where [[Principles by Ray Dalio]] feels a tad unrealistic. Horowitz points out that most business books lay out all the best choices and don't talk about when things go wrong. Kind of feeling like Dalio made that mistake at points. 
- It's not the employees who carry the bad news the heaviest it's the #CEO. By not telling people the bad news you're assuming they can't handle it. When in fact they can handle it better than you.
- #Levers: By keeping bad news to yourself you keep the very information that can improve your business locked up. Expressing bad news is a way of getting it resolved more quickly by increasing the flow of #Information.
- Talking about your #Problems means more people work on them which is better for the company. Also it increases trust. 
- #Trust and #Communication have an inverse relationship. The more trust you have the less you have to communicate. #Levers 
- When laying off employees make it clear that it's the company's fault not the employees. The company failed to meet business goals and that is why #Layoffs are happening. It's not because people didn't do well individually. In the words of right value it's a design problem not a personal problem.
- When you fire an executive from your company again it's not their fault it's your fault. You have to do a root cause analysis to figure out why you hired the wrong person. It's not about them failing. Reminds me of [[Principles by Ray Dalio]]
- Higher for strengths not lack of weaknesses
- McDonald's trains employees, but most, most tech companies don't. That makes no sense.
- #Levers : There's two ways to increase employee performance. One increase motivation and to increase training
- Anything you measure create a set of employee #Behaviors. Alternatively in life anything you measure create a set of behaviors and you as well.
- Horowitz makes an interesting point when he says there's a management equivalent of technical #Debt. Its decisions that require you to pay interest later.
- The purpose of human resources isn't to make your culture great. It's a quality assurance team to make sure your culture doesn't suck.
- Manage Junior employees and executives very very differently. I like Horowitz is characterization of it as fighting a regular person versus fighting a trained boxer you have to treat them very differently.
- To keep politics out of your company you have to create processes and stick to them.
	- #Atomic is done a great job of keeping politics out of it by using the reimbursement curve instead of giving raises on and ask for basis.
- I really like his point that eventually overtime the worst person on your executive team like all the executives will converge to them because all the new executives as they're coming up with benchmark themselves against the worst person. So he comes up with this idea about how to have really clear ideas of competency so you can compare and make sure that someone is actually qualified not in comparison but on those merits
- When a company doubles, everyone gets a new job. That means that everyone must re-qualify for the job. Recall the Shopify episode of Tim Ferriss.


## Fun Facts
- AOL = America OnLine
- Microsoft had a competitor to the internet that would have made it proprietary but Netscape fucked it over as it was going out and pushed the #Internet over the threshold. 
- #Microsoft lost a monopoly suit against the government in the early 2000's
- Horowitz's company LoudCloud helped coin the term #Cloud by doing what AWS does now very badly. They ended up selling LoudCloud but kept the software part of it to create a new company. 

## Quotes
- If you've got to eat shit don't take small bites.
- There are no silver bullets only lead bullets and you need a lot of them to get the job done.


## Reflections
Feels like a poor man's [[Principles by Ray Dalio]]... A lot of the decisions made in the book are made to seem **tough** but come off as careless. While it's understandable that hard decisions have to be made, in light of #Evergreen principles, it's hard to justify some of the decisions he made. In light of other #VC backed or publicly funded companies I guess he could have come out as kind, but it was hard to see that in the book. He's also just kind of a weird dude. He has hip hop lyrics woven throughout his lyrics, which is interesting. I want to learn more about him but I'm also weirded out by him. He seems to be a little bit on the side of toxic masculinity. In comparison with [[Principles by Ray Dalio]], he seems to focus very little on transparency, at least early on. I think an interesting note is that this book is less teachy and more narrative, where he isn't necesarily commenting on the rightness of his actions. 

Chapters 4-8 get better. He was more transparent than I'd previously thought. I am actually coming to think this book is more realistic than [[Principles by Ray Dalio]] because it tells of the hard things. I feel like Dalio, while he did talk about the struggles, glossed over them a bit. It was like #BridgeWater was on one giant elevator, and maybe they were...

After reading this book I've decided I'd rather not be a #CEO. This feels like a big change, not wanting to start my own company. I am realizing that I would not find it interesting. Most of a CEO's job is things I don't like and making decisions that everyone else might dislike (which goes against my desire for consensus).

Questions: 
- Why do lower prices in stores lead to increased prices in fixed cost areas like housing and health care?
- Where does craftsmanship play a role here? [[Shop Class as Soulcraft - An Inquiry into the Value of Work]]
- Why have costs in some areas gone up as others have gone down? 
- Why don't we focus on creating more high paying jobs? Why are we so stuck on cheap?
- Why didn't efforts to stop the creep of cheap work?
- How does globalism work here? Especially interesting is the chapter on #Food.
	- The Irish potato famine occurred even as Ireland exported tons of food. There just was no cheap food.
- Why don't more, cheaper goods make our lives better?


Ideas:

- Shifting of cost to the consumer
	- #Stores used to have sales clerks that helped you find stuff. With the advent of Walmart style shops, they changed the store layout to make it self serve, eliminating the need for help. 
		- #Innovation here were the shopping cart and the checkout line
	- IKEA offloads the cost of assembling their furniture to you. They also make you come to them by limiting the number of their stores
- Low food costs result in food insecurity because people store less (just in time food), deincentives farming (which hurts you when there is less one year), and makes price increases hurt waaay more.

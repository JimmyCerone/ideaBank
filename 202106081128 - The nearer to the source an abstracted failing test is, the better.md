## Idea
- The closest to a function you can get while still maintaining abstraction and being implementation agnostic, the better. 
	- This makes it way easier to iterate on. The higher the level the more work, so we want to minimize how many levels of abstraction away we are. 

[[03062021 - Levers]]: 
- Nearness to implementation
- Abstraction of implementation


## Connections


## Example
- Testing a back end function with a GraphQL test rather than a cypress test since it is closer and maintains independence from implementation

## Idea
- In some ways the more your measure the more there appears to be of something. This seems to be a much ignored fact. 
	- This can also work in the opposite direction that measurement decreases the amount of what you measure. 
- The type of effect depends on how the data is presented. 
	- It's all about [[]]

## Connections
- [[03-03-2021 - Our language creates our reality]] is kind of a corollary here in that numbers define our reality in a different but similar way. James Glieck touches on this with [[The Information - A History, A Theory, A Flood by james Gleick]]. 

## Example
- Measuring my screen time helped me decrease it

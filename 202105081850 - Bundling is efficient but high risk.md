## Idea
- [[03-04-2021 - Unbundling your phone into separate functions]] is the source of this idea. We see this globally as well in [[What We Can learn from a Big Boat Stuck in a Canal]]. 

The [[03062021 - Levers]] here are:
- Efficiency 
- Risk

If you increase efficiency by bundling, you increase risk as well. 

So E is directly related to R. 

E = xR

- Does this hold? In what other areas?
	- [[How to Get Startup Ideas by Paul Graham]] applies here I think because you can be efficient in coming up with ideas, but that increases the risk they suck. 
	- Creative process is like an anti-example because it is both high risk and low efficiency. Not a one to one function I guess.

## Example
- I broke my phone and was flat out of luck because everything is on there. It was way too bundled together.

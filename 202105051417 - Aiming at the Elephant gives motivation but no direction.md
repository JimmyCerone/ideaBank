## Reflections
- Reminds me of [[Start with problems]]. I think problems help us get our emotions engaged while solutions get our "rider". So the best presentations give motivation in the form of problems ([[202105051417 - Aiming at the Elephant gives motivation but no direction]]) and finding solutions gets the rider on board ([[202105051416 - Aiming at the Rider gives direction but not motivation]]).

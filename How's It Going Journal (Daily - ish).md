- Almost done with my first week without Blue. An odd week, because my rock is gone. Been having trouble both going to bed and getting up. Thought I'd be all into reading and stuff but I spend about the same amount of time on it. Working on scaling back and changing all my ambitions to be more community oriented and less serious. My thinking was informed a lot by [[11 Reasons Not to Become Famous - Tim Ferris]] and [[Still Alive by Astral Codex Ten]].
- Presented the Sprint Demo at work, which I thought I would enjoy but just found stressful and kind of boring. [[Sprint Demo Feb 3 2021]].
- Started worked at 8 for once and am gonna be done by 4 which is a weird feeling.  

Friday January 29th

- Today was good. #Blue slept most of the day after playing with Ivy yesterday, which was odd but good. I walked him during my coaching meeting, which seems to work very well. He likes midday walks. Finished work 3/4 an hour ahead on the week which is a fucking miracle. Going to see Liv tonight which I can't wait for. This week working with Meredith was fantastic and she is finally acting funny, which is a blast (only Andy really does it other than her), plus we are crushing stories which makes it exciting. Had a breakthrough with #AtomicObject where I'm going to try to start organizing information as my unofficial role. 

Sunday January 24th 
- Woke up at 8:30 or so (Blue woke up early), edited an article (I'm having so much fun with this - I even like promoting it!), got annoyed at Blue when he wouldn't settle down and let me read Designing Your Life. 
- I really wanted to finish the book because it's been hanging over me forever. 
- Using 5 minute blocks with Blue is great. It helps me engage fully AND know there will be an end time. 


Monday January 25th
- My #Database keeps breaking which sucks. I can't figure out how to fix it. Woke up a tad earlier today, did my writing before work, and started work earlier. What a start to the day. Damn Jimmy.

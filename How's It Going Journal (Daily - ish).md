Sunday January 24th 
- Woke up at 8:30 or so (Blue woke up early), edited an article (I'm having so much fun with this - I even like promoting it!), got annoyed at Blue when he wouldn't settle down and let me read Designing Your Life. 
- I really wanted to finish the book because it's been hanging over me forever. 
- Using 5 minute blocks with Blue is great. It helps me engage fully AND know there will be an end time.

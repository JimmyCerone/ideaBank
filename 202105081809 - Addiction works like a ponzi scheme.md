## Idea
- This is in part because [[202105061734 - Weak ties are strong social motivators]] (the bad side of it) and in part because of the economics of things. 
- I think this applies in lots of areas and could be a powerful way of understanding all kinds of stuff.
	- Does this idea relate to [[202105071403 - Technological systems can be modeled as biological systems]] / [[202105071406 - Technology is self propogating]]? It definitely relates to epidemics and how they propagate ([[202105081812 - Epidemics exhibit network effects]])
	- Social media works this same way - [[202103291159 - Social Media is not a tool]] - it has it's own desires. All this might mean that addiction could be understood as an organism with it's own desires, like [[What Tech Wants by Kevin Kelly]]. 

## Example
- Heroin addiction is like a ponzi scheme because you have to sell to more new people to fund your own habit.

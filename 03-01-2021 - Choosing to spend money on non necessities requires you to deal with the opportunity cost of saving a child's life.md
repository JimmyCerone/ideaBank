As Rockefeller showed in [[Titan The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.]] with hookworm, you can save lives cheaply. Now it's even easier. So we who have means are left pondering the opportunity cost of our every purchase: human lives. 

Previously, this wasn't as much of a thing since everything was more localized. Back in the day, you couldn't send aid across the ocean. Thus you were constrained to worry about more local issues. Now, everything is present at once. 

The author referenced a book title "Living High and Letting Die" where he sourced many of his analogies. 

In an interesting point, the author addresses the idea that some of us are unlucky for having the burden of this on our conscience. It is the opposite.

> If that makes living a morally decent life extremely arduous, well, that is the way things are.

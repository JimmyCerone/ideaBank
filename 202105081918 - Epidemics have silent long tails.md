## Idea
- The long term effects of an epidemic are hidden because they are defined by potential removed from the equation and decreased degrees of freedom (which increases risk - [[202103292312 - Risk can be measured by degrees of freedom]]). 

## Example
- [[Lethal Passage - The Story of a Gun by Erik Larson]], [[Dopesick by Beth Macy]], and the pandemic are all examples of this. We will probably miss many of the long term effects of these unless we look hard because [[202105081913 - Structural problems are difficult to detect]].

## Reflections
- A result of tons of ideas. So really rich in it's connections from [[Risk is not taken into account in our financial system]] in general (since we rely so heavily on #Philanthropy to meet public goods) to [[202103260957 - The more popular you are the more risk you incur]], which is an interesting intersection of #Psychology and #Capitalism. [[202103261047 - There is no such thing as medium risk]] plays into this as well. We don't think of this is a big risk, we think "it's not bad" which means we don't think about it or prep for it. 
- What's interesting is that we don't consider this risk a national security risk. What if we started looking at income inequality as a threat to national security?? Why don't we?

## Example
- Bill and Melinda Gates divorce could upend global markets and change the world of philanthropy

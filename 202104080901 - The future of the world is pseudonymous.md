This comes from [[202103291336 - The Episode of Everything - Balaji on Bitcoin]]. One of my favorite ideas to come out of the podcast yet also the most frightening. 

Balaji painted the world as pseudonymous and cryptographic, which I think is likely. It requires both, though. If we don't go cryptographic, or if #Cryptocurrency is usurped by centralized #Government, then we end up back in the same place with new specs. 

I find I'm passionate about this idea in part because I have skin in the game ([[Using a pseudonym & deleting old social media]]) as a writer. I've gone back and forth about whether I want to be pseudonymous or not. I want to try it, I think. 

## Questions

- What would it mean if nobody knew who I was? 
- What would it mean to have my personal persona and my online persona disconnected?

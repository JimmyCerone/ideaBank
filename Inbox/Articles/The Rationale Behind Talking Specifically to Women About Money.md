## Reflections
- I hadn't thought about the long last effect of financial disparities and income inequality. 
> Today, young women are embracing STEM education, although their confidence in investing is still low. From the same Merrill Lynch/Age Wave report, ‘fully 63% of women ages 18 to 29 say wealth planning is too difficult to even think about’, and ‘one in four women ages 18 or older, and as many as 30% of women ages 30 to 44—critical years for retirement savings—say they have not planned at all for their future.’
- Reminds me that Liv has many of the same struggles - not wanting to think about #Money. Yet she has done so well for herself already. An odd dissonance that she is very good at #Investing yet is uncomfortable with the topic. 
- I hadn't thought of this, but the #Problem goes deeper, reaching to the disparity in STEM #Education. 
- These stats really shocked me and I'd be curious to know what the rates were for men. 
> A 2018 Merrill Lynch/Age Wave study[\[1\]](http://file:///C:/Users/ilene/Downloads/Women+and+Money+Feb+22%20(1).docx#_ftn1) found that sixty-one percent of women would rather talk about their _own death_ than money. And forty-five percent of women say they do not have a financial role model.

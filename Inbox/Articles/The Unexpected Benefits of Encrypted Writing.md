## Reflection
- Not sure what I think about this. I don't know that having things local or even #Encrypted makes me feel all that much better. Someone can always get to your stuff. Sure on #Google you don't know who that is, but people can just as easily hop on my #Computer. There is still that 1% chance. I like the idea here, but not sure I agree with it. 
- I'm also not sure that I want to try a product like [[Standard Note]] just based off of this article.

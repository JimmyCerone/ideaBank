- So frustrating to see the same problems have been around for so long:
> Many African Americans complained of poor #Housing conditions which was exacerbated by “[redlining](https://www.blackpast.org/aah/redlining-1937 "redlining"),” a hidden practice to deny mortgages to people of color to keep them out of white neighborhoods. They also blamed poor educational conditions in the public #Schools and a lack of educational opportunity.  In addition, #Employment discrimination was rampant since many of the white-owned businesses in the area refused to hire black people.

So many layers to discrimination here from #Homes to #Education to #Work.

- Once again, #Police brutality has been around a looong time: 
> As police tackled him to the ground, people began to accuse them of brutality against a “crippled Negro.” Crowds formed and people began throwing rocks and bottles at the police while singing “We Shall Overcome.”

- Messaging and rewriting of #History in calling it a riot: 
> The official report on the riot noted that it was more of a protest against “forms of neglect, deprivation, arbitrary control and abuse than an actual riot.”

## Reflections
- Yet another article from [[Standard Note]], found by [[Jordan Nelson]].  Fascinating look at the #Levers involved in #Privacy , which is something I'm like half in half out on. Most of my privacy chops come from [[Jan Gurlich]]. 
- I love how short and to the point their articles are. I can put almost the whole thing in one note without fear of being overwhelmed later. Gives me food for thought for my own writing. 

## Ideas
1.  **End to End Privacy:** All your data — no matter if you’re using a PC, a phone, a tablet or a gaming system — is encrypted everywhere you _don't control._ On our servers. On our network. On a public network. In the cloud. On mars. Whenever your information moves anywhere away from your direct control, it will be seriously encrypted with a passcode that no one else in the world knows but you.
    
2.  **Secure connections.** Whenever we move your encrypted data over a network, in order to deliver services to you, it is sent over a strictly secure connection to only our private servers. Because this data is encrypted, we can't read it, and we can’t sell it. Even if someone forced their way into our data centers, your data would be complete gibberish to them. Forever.
    
3.  **Open-source:** We've made all our code #OpenSource, so it's clear how your data is being handled every step of the way. Many companies promise encryption but don't open up their code for peer-review. We believe the definition of end-to-end encryption should mean that code on both ends is open-sourced. While trust in a closed system can be convenient at times, nothing is more trustable than mathematical certainty and utter transparency.
    
4.  **No tracking or intrusive advertising.** We are heavily opposed to industry standard tracking tools like Google Analytics, which gathers and analyzes your browsing history to sell you better advertisements. Instead, we use an open-source, privacy-focused, and self-hosted Matomo analytics installation.
    
5.  **Respectful analytics.** We are utterly and completely transparent about reporting exactly what we track, and why. We announce when we update those policies. And we confirm with you that you are comfortable with those changes. To date, our applications, including web, desktop, and mobile, contain no analytics or tracking software whatsoever.

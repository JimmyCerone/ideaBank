## Excerpts 
>No, seriously, it was awful. I [deleted my blog](https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/22/nyt-is-threatening-my-safety-by-revealing-my-real-name-so-i-am-deleting-the-blog/) of 1,557 posts. I wanted to protect my privacy, but I ended up with articles about me in _New Yorker_, _Reason_, and _The Daily Beast_. I wanted to protect my anonymity, but I Streisand-Effected myself, and a bunch of trolls went around posting my real name everywhere they could find. I wanted to avoid losing my day job, but ended up quitting so they wouldn't be affected by the fallout. I lost a five-digit sum in advertising and Patreon fees. I accidentally sent about three hundred emails to each of five thousand people in the process of trying to put my blog back up.
>I had, not to mince words about it, a really weird year.
>513,000 people read my blog post complaining about the _New York Times_' attempt to dox me (for comparison, there are 366,000 people in Iceland). So many people cancelled their subscription that the _Times'_ exasperated customer service agents started pre-empting callers with "Is this about that blog thing?" A friend of a friend reports her grandmother in Slovakia heard a story about me on Slovak-language radio.

## Reflections
A cautionary tale about the dangers of your writing going big. Made me think about my own writing goals very hard.

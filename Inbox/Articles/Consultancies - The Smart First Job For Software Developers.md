## Reflections
- I hadn't realized it until recently, though I guess I thought about it when taking the job, but starting off in a consultancy pulls a lot of #Levers all at once.

## Summary of Benefits
- #Work in a Variety of Industries
- Experience Many Company Cultures
	- Hadn't considered the value of this one but totally get it upon reflection. Volley had an awesome culture, didn't really know Tufts but it seemed stressful and Amway is just wild. Good to know when looking for another spot. 
- Develop a Strong Business Acumen
	- I am so excited about doing more with this one. Got a taste of it on Volley and I am seeing big picture stuff for Amway, but I would love to know how they are tracking their ROI. 
- Gain Cross-Discipline Experience
	- Loving this the more we do our #Design series as many of the practices are so useful. Also fun to get to have input on the project management side in Volley & Tufts.
- Add Technical Expertise
	- I am begrudging about this one at times but it might turn out to be the most useful one around in the end.

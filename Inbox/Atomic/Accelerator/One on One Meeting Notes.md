## Reflections 
- Having something to keep your brain distracted can help you focus by preventing larger distractions 
- Imposter syndrome wasn't a thing when Jesse started. Nobody expected to know anything. For him it made sense that it would take years to grow into the job. 
	- We used to expect the old people to have all the answers and now it's reversed in some ways. The value of experience has gone down. 
- I feel like I'm late in the game to computers
	- You just went from student to professional. You got a huge promotion and you have to settle in first. 
	- Procrastination has a bad connotation, but deferring a decision till a later time can be a really good way to go. 
	- It's hard to measure what you don't know.
		- You feel like you haven't leveled up because the amount you don't know is still infinite. It will always be infinite, which makes it hard to notice leveling up. 
- How did you determine what skills to level up?
	- He didn't too much when he was starting. He worked 9-5 then left work at home. Wasn't a side project guy. When he did take a lot of time to do that kind of stuff, it was when he was unhappy with his role. What drove it was marketability. What drove it was having the skill set he wanted to land a different job or move to a different team. Guilt driven learning. 
- I think I thought college would prepare me for work, but it just prepares you to start learning. It's not the finish of the work, but it's the start. 
	- There's a startup cost to the beginning of your career. You have to get to a certain point and then you have enough knowledge.

## Action Items
- Tackle topics in isolation
	- Work through #Books one by one instead of trying to take on a whole system like building a #React app from scratch with a #Backend
- Block out chunks of time instead of trying to do things #Daily
- Make coding an adventure
	- Write about what you learn every day (makes it motivating to look back on)
	- Find 1 way to be helpful every day
- Compare to your past self - what did you improve? Instead of comparing to others
- For my [[Atomic Improvements]], ask is information organization a #Problem?

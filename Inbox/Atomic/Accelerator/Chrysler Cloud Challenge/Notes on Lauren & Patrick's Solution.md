- Load Balancing between API Gateway and Aurora 
- Subnets are a great touch + VPCs 
- Pricing info is helpful as well 
- Missed lambda between API Gateway and DB
- Cloudtrail is for logging infrastructure changing where cloudwatch tracks api changes
- Elastic Search 
	- Looked into it for #Fusion and decided against it. 
	- Depends on how fast you need queries to respond. 
	- Good at full text search, but doesn't have huge advantages where you are searching by ID or have a constrained search set
		- Would be great for a package description field
- What's the first thing that will break when you hit 10 million users?
	- Lack of load balancer will mess things up quickly
	- Single availability zones and duplicate to multiple zones
		- Regions could segment your data and create big latencies 
- Where would you put a load balancer? 
	- Either between the api gateway and the lambda for processing changes or API gateway and aurora
- Adding a cache would be useful to cut down on time for queries

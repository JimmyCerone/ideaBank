## Action Items
- [ ] Take a second look at user personas on fusion

## User Personas
- Typically take place at the beginning of a project (so many of us haven't had it)
- Caricatures of the users of the software
	- They eliminate assumptions
	- Help you argue with a client to refine the design and prioritize things
	- Helps make things concrete so that you can have a conversation on the facts
- Proto personas are personas built on unvalidated assumptions
	- Most companies stop here with proto personas without validating assumptions
	- We go a step further with user research
- Example: 
	- Amway IBO
		- Assumptions
			- Existing tooling is not good
			- Not enough communication
			- Aim to be close with supervisors and salespeople. 
- "If I could"
	- These statements help users dream and give you an idea of what the ideal build would be
- Includes
	- Goals
	- Frustrations
	- Technical Frustrations
		- Determines the level of training needed and the level of complexity we are able to bring to the table
	- What are they already using?
		- Can use these apps as a benchmark, even if the app isn't directly related. 
	- Empathy Maps
		- Does
		- Feels
		- Occupies
			- Environments they are in
	- Superpowers 
		- You can add these as well - I remember seeing them on the fusion project.
- Names
	- Placeholders can be really distracting. If you pick out celebrities it can take everyone off track.


## Tooling
- These user personas can be super well designed, but you can also just do it on a Google doc
	- You also don't need to use a set format, adapt it based on the situation at hand


## Questions
- Why include the story? 
- How do you figure out the end user to interview?

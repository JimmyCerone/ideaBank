Conversation February 23rd, 2021

### Ideas
- Thinks of the day as a crescendo from less to more social and more creative to more mundane. 
- How did you handle life as a young dev? 
	- Time and development. 
	- Looked for skill gap and asked what was the essential skill gap he could close and keep up? 
		- If you learn how the test frameworks are written, you can understand a language quickly. 
		- Sometimes you need to stop worrying about the domain as a whole and just get stuff done. 
	- Then what is the biggest skill gap on the team? Look for bottlenecks and where people are grumbling.

#### Ideas
- Roger Martin biz strategy author
	- #KnowledgeFunmel
		- Start with a mystery 
		- Moves to heuristics
		- Finally move to algorithms 
	- Our business resists algorithms because of the protfolio of products and processes we work with.
- For us, the customization is the differentiator. 
	- We are experts at becoming experts. We are experts at being generalists. 
- Information value is how to become expert generalists.
- Brand Promise:
	- Great outcome
	- Great experience
- How do we compare across projects that are so different?
- These are #Byproducts from Jason Freid
- This can be both internal and external with marketing
- Tweak approach to maintenance where we can do proactive maintenance through a retainer model. Creates a more consistent revenue stream. 
	- Could we use AO as a cash cow to move into a different field
	- Could we move into strategy consulting. 
	- We can do what we do now for 20 years, but what's next?

#### History
- We used to look at code metrics to measure code. 
	- How many loops do we have? How much unused code do we have?
	- What's our test coverage?
- Micah has been developing a project health metric
- Micah and Drew started a book
	- Challenges exist in getting it done
		- Both were still doing their day job and inexperienced as writers
		- So much focus on the infrastructure of the book that it cut down
- Continuing to put out content that makes us thought leaders

#### Resources
- Ray Dalio, income disparity = bad things and civil unrest.
- IDEO 
	- Been a design leader since the 1980's 
	- Everyone has been writing books about design thinking
	- They talked about their tools, their process, and more in books to build their brand
		- There is an inflection point where they started to say "everyone can be a design thinker" and then it becomes "all of us can do this process"
		- This started to cannibalize their own value
		- This feels like a second order effect from Ray Dalio [[Principles by Ray Dalio]]


#### Questions
- What can we do with video?
- How can we set things up to replicate Atomic in terms of information organization?


#### Action Steps
- Ask Micah about project health metric
	- Ask about The Hard Thing about Hard Things metrics 
- Ask Micah and Drew about the book
	- What's the arc of the story we want to tell? We could break it down chapter by chapter.
		- Separate responsibilities of author and editor. 
		- Could we pull something from Spin
- Organize the books that Atomic has found valuable
- Chat with Elaine in the upcoming year about ideas
	- "I'm going to watch the dev channel and spit out Atomic Bytes" - monthly gems from Atomic
		- Top 5 trends coming from the Atomic Braintrust
			- Interview style video
			- Podcast
		- Annual Look Back
	- Kim's design thinking posts 
- Carl's Written Post on Great Not Big
	- Bureau of Labor Statistics data on near term results on the data
	- Industry Classification codes for this
	- You can start to see this bimodal distribution. 
		- Lots of small shops
		- A few huuuuge shops
		- Thought Works, Pivotal (service & product firm)
	- Consolidation
		- Technical founders start a company, realize they hate running it, and sell. 
	- Companies are buying out design firms instead of developing talent
		- Accenture was banging on doors to get this in.
		- Cultures clash... 
	- Vision for evergreen company is working on the equity succession
		- This works by doing employee owned. 
	- Weird intersections between tech & services

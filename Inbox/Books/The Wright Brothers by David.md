Read this book with [[Neil]] during February of 2021. 

## Fun Facts
- Savant in Spain in 875 covered himself in feathers in an attempt to fly. In 1490, Leanardo da Vinci made the most serious studies. 
- The Wright Brothers study of #Flight started with a #Toy from #France brought home by their father, who believed in toys ability to help in #Education . 
- Super sad fact but Wilbur died when he was only in his 40's. 


## Reflections
- Very interesting contrast with [[Titan The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.]]. Both their #Father s were travelers, Rockefeller's dad was a "healer" and huckster while the Wright's dad was a traveling preacher who loved him (Rockefeller's dad was kind of an ass). Both born in #Ohio, one in Dayton one in Cleveland. It surprised me that Ohio was such a fertile ground for heroes. A few key differences perplexed me. First, the Wright brothers were not obsessed with money at all and weren't religious. Second, they didn't seem to have as many demons chasing them, they seemed calmer. They kept surprising me because I expected them to act like Rockefeller.
	- Were similarly perceived as Rockefeller, thought to be humorless but really funny with those close to them. Similarly avoided fame. Oddly, not as long lived, as Rockefeller was obsessed with living to 100. 
- The brothers reminded me of Joey and I in some ways, as the older one (Wilbur) was more intellectual and Orville was more outgoing.

Read this book with [[Neil]] during February of 2021. 

## Fun Facts
- Savant in Spain in 875 covered himself in feathers in an attempt to fly. In 1490, Leanardo da Vinci made the most serious studies. 
- The Wright Brothers study of #Flight started with a #Toy from #France brought home by their father, who believed in toys ability to help in #Education . 
- Super sad fact but Wilbur died when he was only in his 40's. 
- Wilbur got hit in the face with a hockey stick, which changed his life forever. He was slated to go to Yale, but the injury ended all that. On top of it all, his mother got sick and he started taking care of her (she died a few years after) while still recovering himself. 
	- At the end of his 3 years of recover, he started reading like a maniac
- Even though their father was a bishop, the brothers weren't particularly #Religious and their father was still supportive. 
- The brother's first venture was a local newspaper. It got them into printing and helped start their shop
	- I found it fascinating that they rented their own space. Was this normal then?
- The brothers traded weeks cooking and lived amiably together. Neither ever married. 
	- While at home, they were incredibly handy, redoing their house. They would later build a whole shed on Kitty Hawk to live in and house their creation. 
- At one time Dayton had the most number of patents in any city in the US. What happened? Could you map this geographically?
- Turned down Andrew Carnegie's money - kept it #Bootstrapped
- Father was trapped in a #Church split that wore down both him and wilbur as he wrote letters in favor of his father
- While they were alive there was a national surplus instead of a national debt
- The Wright brothers were incredibly kind and avoided the spotlight when they could.
- Orville had a terrible crash and his passenger died. He took more than a year to recover. 
	- Flew with someone he did not like or trust - the man tried to talk with him while he was flying. The propeller busted off and the plane went down. 
	- That day Teddy Roosevelt had asked to fly. Luckily he was not permitted to. 
- Wilbur flew around the Statue of Liberty, which would never be allowed today and must have been great. 
- They started an airplane company but sold it later. Not sure it went anywhere. 
	- Sold by Orville after Wilbur died
- Wilbur died in 1912 at 45 of Typhoid fever.

## Bike Shop
- #Bike s were the sensation of their time
	- High Wheelers were the original in 1870s and 1880s
	- Safety bicycles, with smaller wheels, were invented a few years later and started a biking craze. An obsession shared by [[Titan The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.]].
- In 1893, the brothers started their own #Shop selling and repairing bikes. 
- Created their own bikes by hand and made custom models they sold for big cash. 
- The Wright bros sold #Photography equipment out of their #Shop

## The Dream
- Yet another twist of tragedy led them towards flight. Orville got typhoid fever and while recovering, Wilbur read him the news about the death of German glider enthusiast Otto Lilienthal. 
	- The dude was insane, steering with his body and launching himself off cliffs and shit. The brothers learned and mitigated #Risk much better. 
	- The brothers approached their work with an #Empiricism that reminded me of Taleb in the [[Black Swan]]. 
- The brothers correctly identified the #Levers involved in flight:
	- Skill
		- To maximize skill, one needed to max out the hours in flight. The best inventors of the day didn't recognize this. 
	- Knowledge
		- Knowledge could be gained from books, but also from experiments. The brothers created their own wind tunnel and thus gained knowledge from direct experience as well as books and observations (bird watching)
- Solved the control problem via wing warping (as you can do by folding parts of the wing on a paper airplane)
- Wilbur almost died on the way out to Kitty Hawk - it was almost completely inaccessible. 
- Another critical realization was that the motor was NOT one of the #Levers . Once the problem of #Balance was solved, adding a motor would be trivial. 
- They built the glider but it was Charlie Taylor's expertise that helped them build the motor (and run the shop while they were gone)
	- He built an engine in 6 weeks that was as good as or better than any in existence
- Innovated once again on propellers making their own
	- Was there anyone to say a propeller was needed? Was that the standard? Who came up with the idea?




## Reflections
- Very interesting contrast with [[Titan The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.]]. Both their #Father s were travelers, Rockefeller's dad was a "healer" and huckster while the Wright's dad was a traveling preacher who loved him (Rockefeller's dad was kind of an ass). Both born in #Ohio, one in Dayton one in Cleveland. It surprised me that Ohio was such a fertile ground for heroes. A few key differences perplexed me. First, the Wright brothers were not obsessed with money at all and weren't religious. Second, they didn't seem to have as many demons chasing them, they seemed calmer. They kept surprising me because I expected them to act like Rockefeller.
	- Were similarly perceived as Rockefeller, thought to be humorless but really funny with those close to them. Similarly avoided fame. Oddly, not as long lived, as Rockefeller was obsessed with living to 100. 
- The brothers reminded me of Joey and I in some ways, as the older one (Wilbur) was more intellectual and Orville was more outgoing. 
- Weirdly harmonious family life was different from [[Titan The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.]] and [[Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World]]. I always thought that important people were forged by great hardship. These two had hardship, but lacked the bitterness and anguish I often see in famous people. 
	- What drove them? I kept asking myself this, wondering why 2 men would work like dogs without anything driving them? No demons?
- The brothers did not believe in #OpenSource and took care to keep their designs and progress secret. Why wouldn't they want open source?
- The brothers were very direct and yet forgiving. Reminds me of [[Joey Dawson]] in a way. Frank, open, and genuine. The time they stuck with Chanute comes to mind. 

## Questions
- Why were the brothers anti #OpenSource? What are the pros and cons of it?
- How important is flying in the historical context of things? When did commercial airlines spring up?
- Has anyone replicated their early flying machines? Do they work well? 
- Who invented the helicopter? Drones?
- At one point in the book they contrast #American #Children with better behaved #French ones. Is there really a difference? Does it persist?
- Why didn't they get married?
- When did motorcycles come along? How did Honda disrupt this industry?
- What was the heritage of the Wright Brothers?
- What happened to Dayton and Ohio more generally between then and now?
- How many letters did the brothers write? Where are all their letters kept? 
- Did their descendants do anything interesting? They didn't have any did they...
- What's the difference between a wired and wireless telegraph?
- How often were inventors the one that commercialized their technology?
- How did we go from their gliders to commercial airliners in 100 years?
	- Part of it is that once you get to a high enough altitude, you are basically gliding. But still, the question intrigues me. 
- Why were they so impervious to fame?
	- Reminds me of [[11 Reasons Not to Become Famous - Tim Ferris]]. 
	> There was no boasting, no preening, no getting too big for their britches, as said, and it was this, almost as much as their phenomenal achievements, that was so greatly admired. 

## Connections
- A small quote reminded me of [[Queer Eye]]. When they were on Kitty Hawk, there were no fish even though the lived among fisherman. Same idea as a home builder who's home is always half design (a dude on Queer eye was like this)
- The brothers struggled to deal with fame and still get work done. It was different back then, I think, but calls to mind [[11 Reasons Not to Become Famous - Tim Ferris]] nonetheless. 

## Quotes
> My brother and I do not form many intimate friendships, and do not lightly give them up.

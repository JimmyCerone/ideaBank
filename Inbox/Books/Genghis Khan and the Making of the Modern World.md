# Ideas
- The Mongol empires fell during the Black Plague because the trade connections that sustained the various empires broke down. 
	- #Mongol s basically acted as 4 #Companies when they divided, each holding "shares" of the other and trading goods
- The #Racism of #Science is on clear display towards the end of the book, where Europeans disdain the very same people that gave them such principles. In a doubly terrible thing, they called people with #Disabilities Mongoloid and thus considered them less than human.

# Reflections

- Fascinating book that connects with [[Sapiens]] in that it uncovers history that I'd never known. 
- Mongols had such advanced society... With #Religious #Freedom and everything. 
- Reminds me of [[Factfulness]] in that the trend is reversing. Asia used to be a world superpower and is now fast developing back into one. 
- It was fascinating to see how Ghenghis's children differed so greatly from himself. An oddly modern or eternal problem for a great empire to face. Weird as well to think he kept his traditions, but his children did not. Reminds me a lot of the Lakota when they were fighting the US.

While the warrior lived , the horsehair banner carried his destiny ; in death , it became his soul . The physical body was quickly abandoned to nature , but the soul lived on forever in those tufts of horsehair to inspire future generations .

In the sixteenth century , one of his descendants , the lama Zanabazar , built the monastery with a special mission to fly and protect his banner . Through storms and blizzards , invasions and civil wars , more than a thousand monks of the Yellow Hat sect of Tibetan Buddhism guarded the great banner , but they proved no match for the totalitarian politics of the twentieth century . The monks were killed , and the Spirit Banner disappeared .

Year by year , he gradually defeated everyone more powerful than he was , until he had conquered every tribe on the Mongolian steppe . At the age of fifty , when most great conquerors had already put their fighting days behind them , Genghis Khan’s Spirit Banner beckoned him out of his remote homeland to confront the armies of the civilized people who had harassed and enslaved the nomadic tribes for centuries . In the remaining years of life , he followed that Spirit Banner to repeated victory across the Gobi and the Yellow River into the kingdoms of China , through the central Asian lands of the Turks and the Persians ,

Genghis Khan’s innovative fighting techniques made the heavily armored knights of medieval Europe obsolete , replacing them with disciplined cavalry moving in coordinated units . Rather than relying on defensive fortifications , he made brilliant use of speed and surprise on the battlefield , as well as perfecting siege warfare to such a degree that he ended the era of walled cities . Genghis Khan taught his people not only to fight across incredible distances but to sustain their campaign over years , decades , and , eventually , more than three generations of constant fighting .

In twenty - five years , the Mongol army subjugated more lands and people than the Romans had conquered in four hundred years .

Genghis Khan conquered more than twice as much as any other man in history .

At its zenith , the empire covered between 11 and 12 million contiguous square miles , an area about the size of the African continent and considerably larger than North America ,

In American terms , the accomplishment of Genghis Khan might be understood if the United States , instead of being created by a group of educated merchants or wealthy planters , had been founded by one of its illiterate slaves , who , by the sheer force of personality , charisma , and determination , liberated America from foreign rule , united the people , created an alphabet , wrote the constitution , established universal religious freedom , invented a new system of warfare , marched an army from Canada to Brazil , and opened roads of commerce in a free - trade zone that stretched across the continents . On every level and from any perspective , the scale and scope of Genghis Khan’s accomplishments challenge the limits of imagination and tax the resources of scholarly explanation .

### Highlight (blue) - Page 11 · Location 143

No one in China had heard of Europe , and no one in Europe had heard of China , and , so far as is known , no person had made the journey from one to the other . By the time of his death in 1227 , he had connected them with diplomatic and commercial contacts that still remain unbroken .

As he smashed the feudal system of aristocratic privilege and birth , he built a new and unique system based on individual merit , loyalty , and achievement . He took the disjointed and languorous trading towns along the Silk Route and organized them into history’s largest free - trade zone . He lowered taxes for everyone , and abolished them altogether for doctors , teachers , priests , and educational institutions . He established a regular census and created the first international postal system . His was not an empire that hoarded wealth and treasure ; instead , he widely distributed the goods acquired in combat so that they could make their way back into commercial circulation .

people . At a time when most rulers considered themselves to be above the law , Genghis Khan insisted on laws holding rulers as equally accountable as the lowest herder . He granted religious freedom within his realms , though he demanded total loyalty from conquered subjects of all religions . He insisted on the rule of law and abolished torture , but he mounted major campaigns to seek out and kill raiding bandits and terrorist assassins . He refused to hold hostages and , instead , instituted the novel practice of granting diplomatic immunity for all ambassadors and envoys , including those from hostile nations with whom he was at war .

History has condemned most conquerors to miserable , untimely deaths . At age thirty - three , Alexander the Great died under mysterious circumstances in Babylon , while his followers killed off his family and carved up his lands . Julius Caesar’s fellow aristocrats and former allies stabbed him to death in the chamber of the Roman Senate . After enduring the destruction and reversal of all his conquests , a lonely and embittered Napoleon faced death as a solitary prisoner on one of the most remote and inaccessible islands on the planet . The nearly seventy - year - old Genghis Khan , however , passed away in his camp bed , surrounded by a loving family , faithful friends , and loyal soldiers ready to risk their life at his command .

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 13 · Location 173

Contrary to the many stories about his demise , his death in a nomad’s ger , essentially similar to the one in which he had been born , illustrated how successful he had been in preserving the traditional way of life of his people ; yet , ironically , in the process of preserving their lifestyle , he had transformed human society .

Long after the Mongol Empire collapsed , and other foreign armies invaded parts of Mongolia , the Mongols prevented anyone from entering the sacred precinct of their ancestor . Despite the eventual conversion of the Mongols to Buddhism , his successors nevertheless refused to allow priests to build a shrine , a monastery , or a memorial to mark his burial .

The Mongols made no technological breakthroughs , founded no new religions , wrote few books or dramas , and gave the world no new crops or methods of agriculture . Their own craftsmen could not weave cloth , cast metal , make pottery , or even bake bread . They manufactured neither porcelain nor pottery , painted no pictures , and built no buildings . Yet , as their army conquered culture after culture , they collected and passed all of these skills from one civilization to the next .

### Highlight (blue) - Page 15 · Location 202

The only permanent structures Genghis Khan erected were bridges . Although he spurned the building of castles , forts , cities , or walls , as he moved across the landscape , he probably built more bridges than any ruler in history .

When their highly skilled engineers from China , Persia , and Europe combined Chinese gunpowder with Muslim flamethrowers and applied European bell - casting technology , they produced the cannon , an entirely new order of technological innovation , from which sprang the vast modern arsenal of weapons from pistols to missiles .

The new technology , knowledge , and commercial wealth created the Renaissance in which Europe rediscovered some of its prior culture , but more importantly , absorbed the technology for printing , firearms , the compass , and the abacus from the East . As English scientist Roger Bacon observed in the thirteenth century , the Mongols succeeded not merely from martial superiority ; rather , “ they have succeeded by means of science . ” Although the Mongols “ are eager for war , ” they have advanced so far because they “ devote their leisure to the principles of philosophy . ”

The portrait of the Mongols left by Chaucer or Bacon bears little resemblance to the images we know from later books or films that portray Genghis Khan and his army as savage hordes lusting after gold , women , and blood .

With the passage of centuries , scholars weighed the atrocities and aggression committed by men such as Alexander , Caesar , Charlemagne , or Napoleon against their accomplishments or their special mission in history . For Genghis Khan and the Mongols , however , their achievements lay forgotten , while their alleged crimes and brutality became magnified .

### Highlight (pink) - Page 19 · Location 271

Voltaire portrayed Genghis Khan as a man resentful of the superior virtues of the civilization around him and motivated by the basic barbarian desire to ravish civilized women and destroy what he could not understand .

When doctors wanted to account for why mothers of the superior white race could give birth to retarded children , the children’s facial characteristics made “ obvious ” that one of the child’s ancestors had been raped by a Mongol warrior . Such blighted children were not white at all but members of the Mongoloid race .

His homeland and the area where he rose to power remained closed to the outside world by the Communists of the twentieth century , who kept it as tightly sealed as the warriors had done during the prior centuries .

research was nearly finished when I arrived in Mongolia in 1998 to finalize the project with some background on the area of Genghis Khan’s youth in what , I assumed , would be a final , brief excursion . That trip turned into another five years of far more intensive research than I could have imagined . I found Mongolians to be delirious at their freedom from centuries of foreign rule , and much of the excitement centered on honoring the memory of their founding father , Genghis Khan .

For the first time in nearly eight centuries , the forbidden zone of his childhood and burial was open at the same time that the coded text of the Secret History had finally been deciphered . No single scholar could complete the task , but working together with a team from different backgrounds , we could begin to find the answers .

The text recounts that Genghis Khan first became a clan chief at Khokh Lake by Khara Jirugen Mountain , which meant a Blue Lake by Back - Heart - Shaped Mountain . The identity of that place had been preserved for centuries and was easily found by anyone .

Although we debated the precise identity of the hillock along the Onon River where he had been born , for example , it was obvious that the wooded river with its many marshes differed greatly from the open steppe where most nomads lived and where most historians had assumed Genghis Khan grew up .

### Highlight (blue) - Page 28 · Location 422

The landscape itself tied the early life of Genghis Khan more firmly into the Siberian cultures , from which the Secret History said the Mongols originated , than into the Turkic tribes of the open plains . This information in turn greatly influenced our understanding of Genghis Khan’s field methods and how he treated hostile civilians as animals to be herded but hostile soldiers as game to be hunted .

OF THE THOUSANDS OF cities conquered by the Mongols , history only mentions one that Genghis Khan deigned to enter . Usually , when victory became assured , he withdrew with his court to a distant and more pleasant camp while his warriors completed their tasks .

While one part of his army took the direct route from Mongolia to attack the sultan’s border cities head - on , he had secretly pulled and pushed another division of warriors over a distance longer than any other army had ever covered — two thousand miles of desert , mountains , and steppe — to appear deep behind enemy lines , where least expected .

For the Mongols , the one God was the Eternal Blue Sky that stretched from horizon to horizon in all four directions . God presided over the whole earth ; he could not be cooped up in a house of stone like a prisoner or a caged animal , nor , as the city people claimed , could his words be captured and confined inside the covers of a book .

Genghis Khan’s army combined the traditional fierceness and speed of the steppe warrior with the highest technological sophistication of Chinese civilization .

In battle , this meant the unbridled use of terror and surprise . In peace , it meant the steadfast adherence to a few basic but unwavering principles that created loyalty among the common people . Resistance would be met with death , loyalty with security .

For precisely seven hundred years , from that day in 1220 until 1920 , when the Soviets moved in , Genghis Khan’s descendants ruled as khans and emirs over the city of Bukhara in one of the longest family dynasties in history .

Surrounded by strangers , Hoelun labored far away from the family that had raised her and the world she knew . This place was not her home , and the man who now claimed her as his wife was not the man whom she had married .

Too poor to afford the presents necessary to make a marriage with a wife such as Hoelun , and perhaps unwilling to perform the traditional bride - service for her parents , the hunter chose the second most common way of obtaining a wife on the steppes : kidnapping .

Smelling carries deeply emotional meanings on different levels that vary from the familial sniff between parent and child to the erotic sniff between lovers . Each person’s breath and unique body aroma is thought to constitute a part of that person’s soul .

Even more troubling for Hoelun than the status of her captor was that he already had a wife or concubine , Sochigel , and a son with her . Hoelun would have to struggle for her position within the family .

They asserted , then and now , a direct descent from the Huns , who founded the first empire on the high steppe in the third century . Hun is the Mongolian word for human being , and they called their Hun ancestors Hun - nu , the people of the sun .

As one Mongolian student explained to me , the word was best exemplified by “ the look in the eye of a horse that is racing where it wants to go , no matter what the rider wants . ”

### Highlight (orange) - Chapter 1 > Page 50 · Location 713

For the Mongols , fighting functioned as more of a cyclical system of raiding than of true warfare or even sustained feuding . Revenge often served as the pretext for a raid , but it rarely acted as the true motivator .

The children apparently liked each other , and the fathers agreed to betroth them . During his time of apprenticeship , or bride - service , Temujin was expected to live and work under the protective eyes of his in - laws . Gradually , the intended couple would become ever more intimate . Because the girl was normally slightly older than the boy , as was the case with Borte and Temujin , she would initiate him into sexual intimacy at the rate and in the timing that seemed appropriate to the two of them .

Without Yesugei to help them fight and hunt , the Tayichiud decided they had little use for his two widows and their seven young children . In the harsh environment of the Onon River , the clan could not possibly feed nine extra people .

For Hoelun to wave the banner of her dead husband was not merely to wave his emblem but to parade his very soul in front of the deserting tribesmen . They indeed felt such shame in the presence of his soul , and fear of possible supernatural retribution from it , that they temporarily returned to the camp .

From infancy , they learned to ride with their parents or older siblings until , after only a few years , they managed to hold on by themselves and ride alone . Usually by age four , children had mastered riding bareback ,

These skills later gave the Mongols a great advantage because , unlike almost every other army , the Mongols easily rode and even fought on frozen rivers and lakes .

Like the horse that must be first in every race , Temujin had determined he would lead , not follow . In order to achieve this primacy of place , he proved himself willing to violate custom , defy his mother , and kill whoever blocked his path , even if it was his own family member .

### Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 1 > Page 59 · Location 873

Until this time Hoelun’s family had been a band of outcasts , but not criminals . The killing changed all that and gave anyone who wanted it an excuse to hunt them down .

The Tayichiud took him back to their main camp where , in an effort to break his will , they strapped him into a cangue , a device something like an ox yoke , which permitted him to walk but immobilized his hands and prevented him from feeding himself or even getting a drink of water unaided .

The children of the family also persuaded their father to violate his orders by removing the cangue at night , to let Temujin rest more peacefully .

This other family , which had no kinship tie to him , proved willing to risk their lives to help him . This episode seems to have instilled in him not only a distrust of higher - ranking people , but also the conviction that some people , even those outside his clan , could indeed be trusted as if they were family .

Unlike the scattered lineages and clans of the Mongols , the Kereyid constituted a powerful tribal confederacy that embraced a large group of tribes united under a single khan .

### Highlight (orange) - Chapter 1 > Page 62 · Location 928

To be allies , men had to belong to the same family , and therefore every alliance between men not connected through biology had to be transformed into ceremonial or fictive kinship . Thus , with Temujin’s father and the would - be Kereyid leader having been ceremonial brothers as andas , Temujin now sought to be treated as a son to the old man .

Without churches or monasteries among the nomads , the tribal branch of Christianity claimed descent from the Apostle Thomas and relied on wandering monks .

Kinship was not so much the determinant of relationships as it was a general idiom through which people made , negotiated , and enforced their social claims .

As the months passed with Temujin following Jamuka’s leadership , the account in the Secret History suggests that Jamuka began to treat Temujin less like an anda and more like a younger brother , also emphasizing that Jamuka’s clan descended from the eldest son of their common ancestor .

Temujin , however , assigned some dozen responsibilities to various followers according to the ability and loyalty of the individual without regard to kinship . He gave the highest positions as his personal assistants to his first two followers , Boorchu and Jelme , who had shown persistent loyalty to him for more than a decade . Temujin Khan exercised a decisive ability to assess a man’s talents and assign him to precisely the right task based on his ability rather than his genealogy .

To prevent their regrouping against him , Jamuka then perpetrated one of the cruelest shows of revenge ever recorded on the steppe .

As a sign that he stood ready to fight Buri , Belgutei pulled the top of his clothing down , leaving most of his upper body exposed . Rather than wrestle Belgutei , as would have been the custom in a disagreement among equals , Buri treated Belgutei with contempt as a lesser by unsheathing his sword and slicing Belgutei across the shoulder with it .

Barren as Avarga may have been , it constitutes on a grand scale the steppe herder’s ideal home territory . Herders desire a ger that faces south in order to admit the light and warmth of the southern sun through the entryway as well as to prevent the cold northern winds from entering . They want to face water , but not be too close . A thirty - minute walk from the river seems to be the right distance to avoid polluting it with too much human waste . That distance also provides protection from the summer insects and flash floods that sometimes rage along the river plains .

Although Temujin’s followers prospered for four years in their new home as the size of his tribe continued to grow , Jamuka refused to recognize his leadership , and increasingly became the rallying figure for the aristocratic clans who did not like the changes Temujin was bringing to their traditional way of life .

For a Mongol , public nakedness is a great sign of debasement , and had one of the Tayichiud seen him going through the camp naked at night , they probably would have assumed that he was one of their own getting up to relieve himself .

He organized his warriors into squads , or arban , of ten who were to be brothers to one another . No matter what their kin group or tribal origin , they were ordered to live and fight together as loyally as brothers ; in the ultimate affirmation of kinship , no one of them could ever leave the other behind in battle as a captive .

Once the Naiman spread out , Temujin switched to his third tactic .

Most leaders , whether kings or presidents , grew up inside the institutions of some type of state .

Superior weapons , in the end , did not account for the Mongol success . Weapon technology does not remain secret for long , and whatever works for one side can be readily adopted for use by the enemy after just a few battles .

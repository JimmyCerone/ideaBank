## The Great American Tap Rap

- Page 1: Started in tap at age 4 yet was later switched by her mother to modern - wouldn't think of tap again until she was 25 and saw it on the big screen with Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers

- Page 6: Combined her love of writing and dance after a trip to Greece and dug up the tap masters who had gone underground after the Great Tap Drought.

- Page 7: Began studying under Stanley brown then went to NYC to find more folks

 - Side note: Living situation was terrible.

- Page 9: "Where Gregory idolized Sammy Davis, Jr., I idolized Isadora Duncan. Gregory...defined tap in terms of the Challenge...being the best...I felt tap was a "sensibility". Gregory was commercial, practical, all about tap dancers making a living at tap. I was anti-commercial, performance art, left wing, romantic, (although I still wanted to make a living at it)."

- Page 14: First encounter with “Real” tappers in the business in 1974, met Chuck Green and more. Wanted to “get their feet”. 

- Page 16: With old school tappers, a lesson is a “session” - reminds me of Heather’s experience. Also, teaching was not done in the studio and Chuck Green didn’t know how to break his steps down. Led to her discovery that all tappers are historians. 

- Page 19: Bubbles pioneered dropping his heels, which changed the art form by adding sound and connecting it to jazz. 

- Page 20: Jazz was not old, but had gone underground. It was also old though, originating with slaves. 

- Page 21: Closed vs open hoofing. #Hoofing that “could sell” was open hoofing like Fred Astaire. 

- Page 25: Called Honi Coles every week for months to try to set up a time to work with him. This introduced her to the Copasetics.

- Page 29: The #Copasetics Ball was a real turning point, it introduced her to a whole new world of tap and helped her answer history questions that plagued her while introducing her to the people that made the history. 

- Page 31: 1949 group of entertainers commemorated Bill “Bojangles” Robinson by forming a group called the Copasetics, derived from the yiidish “copa Seder” which means everything is in order. 

- Page 34-35: A who’s who of the performance - so many legends.

## John Bubbles - Stage Father

- John Bubbles created a new style by dropping his heels, adding more #Syncopation, and putting #Tap into the #Jazz bracket.

- Recurring theme of the Challenge came up: 
	> My whole life was based on that - the Challenge against the other fellow.

### Page 94
> I already knew how to turn so I walked into the Hoofers' Club and did my turn and was booed out. I went to California and when I came back, I was a dancer. I had everything. I went back to the club and ran everybody out. I practiced day and night under theaters, and backstage. 
	- The Hoofers' club was a room in Harlem that was for tap dancers - where you could dance all night long. Lots of folks got good here

### Page 95
> "Some people have complained that the song 'Shine' put the negro down," I said. "Did you think so?" I used the word "negro" instead of "black" because I had been reading Stearns. The Stearns had published their book in 1966, and had used the word "negro" to define African Americans. I also knew "negro" was the word Bubbles most identified with and he was extremely race conscious in all his conversations. "How could they put the negro down?" he responded impatiently. "the words to that song are beautiful."

### Page 96
- Taught Fred Astaire and slowed things down for him since his style was so hard to learn. His goal was to keep the audience clapping the whole damn time. 

### Page 97
- Became an advisor of sorts for her career, giving her hard earned praise and pointed critiques. 

### Page 99
- Late in life had a stroke and thus taught Jane how to tap using his hands on hers to show her the rhythms. 
- Revealed the tough side of showbiz, in the questioning your own worth outside of your craft.

## Ginger Rogers
### Page 103
- Learned to make up dances in the neighborhoods growing up. 
- Very tough interview, didn't like people asking certain questions and wouldn't reveal where and how she learned to #Dance, nor did she quite claim being a dancer (felt it was a part of showbiz that she had to learn, not the whole thing)

### Page 104
> Gamely I went on. I asked her about #Women in #Tap. "Women today are so liberated," she said. "They'd like to kick their sisters right in the rear and I don't think that's nice 'cause they'll go right out and vote for a man when there's a woman who could probably do the job just as well. See, the innate jealousy of the human mind is something you just can't cope with." She launched into a long rap about how companies screw women, and how women should be able to stand up for other women.  

### Page 105
- Had some interesting ideas about limiting beliefs and was very pragmatic about her craft and career. Also very focused on the now: 
	> "I don't compare. As Shakespeare said, 'Comparisons are odious.' You're asking me limited questions because your thoughts are limited and until you dispose of them, my girl, those thoughts aren't going to hurt me. They're going to hurt you. There's an old saying: 'The head that thinks it is the head that hurts.'"

## Context
The author is reflecting on his time with the patient Marie and realizing how hard it is for humans to communicate. He's spent hundreds of hours with this patient yet can't transfer impressions in any meaningful way to another. 

## Idea
- #Problem: We can't communicate with other people via our minds(yet, see [Elon](https://news.yahoo.com/everything-know-neuralink-elon-musks-103000152.html)). Our minds work in images, yet we communicate in words and thus we lose tons of fidelity on that. 
	- An interesting note is that #Art attempts to circumvent this problem by communicating in images and metaphors, higher fidelity conversations. 
	- This has implications for #Therapy because there is a limit to what you can know about a patient or vice versa. There is also the fact that we have #Privacy and can choose what we do or don't want to disclose. In the future, this could be gone, which reminds me of [[Superintelligence]] and Ai. 
	- There's a further #Encrypted layer here - what we know from others we have to deconstruct and work backwards to imagine what they might have used to encode the information. It's just like decrypting a password. 
	- The encryption is further compounded by bias, like that talked about in [[The Righteous Mind by Jonathon Haidt]]... 
	- Yet another application of this idea is diagnosis and the standards #Psychology establishes for them. The author is against these precisely because we cannot fully know another. 

## Connections
- As I'm reading this, I'm reminded of the [[Shared realities with different interpretations]] idea that came up earlier in the book. We end up with different interpretations because we don't know all things and we each know a different slice of things. We don't know all things about each other because we can't communicate with full fidelity (at least that's part of the reason).

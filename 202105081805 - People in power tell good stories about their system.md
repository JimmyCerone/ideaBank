## Idea
- When people in power say, "Life has never been better" or "most people are happy", they are spinning a story that supports their position. 
	- [[202103131751 - Power imbalances attract those who seek control]] and controlling the narrative is one of the most powerful systems of control because [[03-03-2021 - Our language creates our reality]]. 
- What stories should we buy then? How do we find stories that are told by the non-powerful / biased?
	- [[Read uncommon sources of information]] & [[202103131903 - The problems that an outsider observes are vastly different than those an insider identifies]] have implications here. Huh. Reminds me of [[A People's History of Computing by Joy Lisi Raskin]] & [[A People's History of the United States by Howard Zinn]]

## Example
> But when the slaves begin to say No to the God-behavior of the masters, the masters are surprised. They are surprised because they thought the slaves were happy. They cannot believe that the hostilities of the slaves stem from anything that the masters themselves have done. But neither can they believe that the unrest in the slave camps is motivated from within the slave community. Therefore, in an attempt to explain the phenomenon of slave hostility, the masters devise tests which will show that most, if not all, people in the society are happy, and the disorders are created by outside agitators who can easily be lumped into one category—Communists. All unhappiness is a lie created and perpetuated by the ungodly Communists who want to destroy the "free" American society.

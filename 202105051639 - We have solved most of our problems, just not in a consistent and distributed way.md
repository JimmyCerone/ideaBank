## Idea
- Kind of an interesting corollary to [[202104070856 - The future is already here, it's just not evenly distributed]]. Interesting how this connects to [[The Power of Habits by Charles Duhigg]] and the levers at work in habit formation. I really want to think about this in terms of [[Limit my consumption of books and articles]] and [[Change how I handle information input]].

## Example
- No one is an alcoholic all the time, they have "solved" sobriety at different points in there lives, just not consistently and evenly distributed over time and space. 

Interesting to think of this in terms of [[03062021 - Levers]]:
- Time
	- When did you last solve this problem? 
- Space
	- Where did you last solve this problem?
- Social
	- Who did you last solve this problem with?
- Strategies
	- What strategy last worked?

The biggest #Risk when it comes to #Cryptocurrency, especially #Bitcoin is that it assumes all nodes are connected in a global #Internet - according to Balaji from [[202103291336 - The Episode of Everything - Balaji on Bitcoin]]. 

The risk here is that #China has a few options: 
1. Do nothing
2. Put up a firewall but allow mining
3. Put up a #Firewall and ban #Mining

The second option is the most Machevellian because it would blow up Bitcoin as it would throw everything out of whack on the chain and disrupt the trust in the ledger (this wouldn't happen for #Ethereum).

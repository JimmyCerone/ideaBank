One of the mental frameworks that we like to use is the idea of #Levers. This mental framework is best described by contrasting with the framework of #Gears. In our parlance, gears mean tiny optimizations to capture incremental gains. When you think of swimmers shaving their legs to decrease drag, that is the epitome of the gears mindset. If you want to learn more about this concept, James Clear conveniently wrote a whole book about it called [Atomic Habits](https://www.alibris.com/Atomic-Habits-An-Easy-Proven-Way-to-Build-Good-Habits-Break-Bad-Ones-James-Clear/book/40738130?matches=48). 

  

Levers, on the other hand, focus on big, simple changes. Jimmy came across this idea while thinking about how to decrease his monthly spending on gas for his car. He realized there were 3 levers he had at his disposal:

1.  Cost of gas
    
2.  Distance Driven
    
3.  Efficiency
    

The gear based approach would have had him [learning to coast](https://www.dailyfueleconomytip.com/driving-habits/fuel-economy-tip-coasting/), religiously using the [GasBuddy app](https://www.gasbuddy.com/home), and cutting out trips to see friends. The lever based clarified his thoughts because he was looking for big results. Even by using the best “gear” methods, Jimmy realized he’d only save $5-10 / month. To get real #Savings, he’d have to make big, bold changes, using levers. 

  

The levers approach would be to cut out driving outside of the essentials, which would result in real, big savings. Jimmy realized this was a no go as he values his friends and family more than savings. Since there are no levers available for big changes in gas price, that was no longer a concern. Finally, meaningful increases in efficiency could be had by buying a new #Car. In sum, Jimmy realized that to cut his gas bill by a lot, he’d have to buy a new car. Interesting, but not something for right now. With that, Jimmy stopped worrying about his gas bill.

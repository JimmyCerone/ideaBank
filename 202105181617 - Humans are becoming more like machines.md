## Idea
> the more pressing problem now is that, through the thinning out of our interactions, humans are becoming machine-like.
## Connections
- We used to think the danger of the future was that robots would take over but the reality is more like the opposite. A perfect example of [[202105051730 - Kevin Kelly on the Tim Ferriss Show]]'s idea [[202105031552 - The future is unbelievable now and what's believable now isn't the future]]. 
- Kind of scary especially in light of [[How the Personal Computer Broke the Human Body]] as well. 
- [[202103170955 - Attention spans shrink when working from home because of feeling trapped]] is accelerating this or being caused by this. It's weird because our ability to multi task seems like a strength but is in fact a weakness ([[202104300005 - Humans can't multitask]]). We see this often in #WFH (like when I did laundry today)

## Example
- Our increasing dependence on machines for memory because [[Humans have limited memories]] and we miss that we [[202104300025 - Exosomatic memory systems mean we are already bionic]]. Really plays into [[202104070856 - The future is already here, it's just not evenly distributed]].

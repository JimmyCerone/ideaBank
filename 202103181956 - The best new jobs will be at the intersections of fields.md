## Context
- I got this #Idea while worrying about my #Work security as I listened to [[The Elephant and the Dragon by Robyn Meredith]]. If my job can be exported (not sure mine can be at #AtomicObject, which is interesting, but #Software can be - which puts atomic at #Risk), how can I hedge against that? 
	
	
## Idea
- What I realized when considering the above question is that there will always be room in the middle. Between countries as we grow more into #Globalism. Between #Tech and #People as we further #Industrial ize. And so on. I know many places are cutting out the middle man, but I think in part that simply creates more of them. Bitcoin aims to cut down on middle men, yet middle men are needed to explain and #Commercialize it. 


## Reflections
- What I find interesting about this #Idea is that it doesn't pigeon hole me career wise. I could work at the intersections in #Writing, #Coding, or with #Entrepreneurship.

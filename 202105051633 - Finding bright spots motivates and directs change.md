## Idea
- Similar to the idea of small wins from [[The Power of Habits by Charles Duhigg]]. Based on solution focused therapy, which I'm pretty sure [[Aaron Reider]] practices. 

## Example
- When struggling with a problem, ask how you have solved it in the past because [[202105051639 - We have solved most of our problems, just not in a consistent and distributed way]].

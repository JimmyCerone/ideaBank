## Reflections
- [[Neil]] and I ran into this hard with [[Deep Sight]]. Lots of people hyped us up without vetting our idea and being super honest. 

## Connections
- Very deeply connected with [[How to Get Startup Ideas by Paul Graham]] which solves this problem by focusing on relevant problems, not solutions. I think that the dude who wrote [[I'm Walking Away From the Product I Spent a Year Building]] got this wrong by using the manifesto. At first I thought that a manifesto was a great way to get feedback, but now I'm less sure. Though I guess it does start with a problem so who knows? Maybe it's worth a try.

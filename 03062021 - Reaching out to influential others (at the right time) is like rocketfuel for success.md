## Context
- So many people have "made it" by reaching out at the right time to the right people (probably mostly luck). I was reminded of this while reading [[The Wright Brothers by David]], where Wilbur writes a letter to the Smithsonian asking for resources about flight. This letter ended up connecting him with many of the best resources and top fliers of the day. It reminds me of when I asked curators for help while writing my paper about Native American women and their #Art at the #OregonExtension. I got so much out of the books they recommended. 
- The brothers did this again when asking around for a testing location, eventually settling on Kitty Hawk. I think [[Neil]] and I could start to pilot this, as I did on Reddit here: https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/lymch4/has_anyone_ever_come_across_a_terminal_that_plays/

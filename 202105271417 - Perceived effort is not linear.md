## Idea
- Incremental gains in effort become quite hard at a certain level and can also become much easier. [[Jesse Hill]] talks about this at work where right now I'm at close to 100% of effort which is exhausting, but soon this will be 95% effort which is much easier. 

## Connections
- [[How Bad Do You Want It? by Matt Fitzgerald]] talks about effort level as perceived and influenced by a variety of factors (including practice as [[202105051112 - Self control is a limited quantity]] but a trainable one, according to [[Switch - How to Change Things When Change is Hard by Dan and Chip Heath]] and [[The Power of Habits by Charles Duhigg]]). 
- [[Black Swan by Nassim Taleb]] is huge on extremistan and this is an interesting case of extremistan. Effort level is not normally distributed which makes it hard for us to think about. Reminds me of all my habits, where adding 1 extra habit, even a small thing, can break the camels back. Also reminds me of my article where I wrote about the number of things vs the amount of time each takes. 
- [[202103291336 - The Episode of Everything - Balaji on Bitcoin]]
	- Reminds me of the future is distributed unevenly and bright spots from [[Switch - How to Change Things When Change is Hard by Dan and Chip Heath]]. I think we can figure out how to lower perceived effort by looking at where it is low and what is different about those circumstances. 

## Example
- Biking at 100% is multiple factors of magnitude harder than biking at 70%. It's not 1.5 times harder, it's like 5-10 times harder due to the [[202104050901 - Law of diminishing returns]]

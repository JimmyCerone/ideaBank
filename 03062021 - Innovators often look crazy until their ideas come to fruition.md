## Context
- [[Range]] showed that accepted experts are often mistaken. We trust the wrong people. Often it is those we consider crazy who are rethinking the basic #Assumptions of our time. In modern times, I'm thinking of #Bitcoin. Many people laugh at it and there are indeed ridiculous people surrounding the industry, but there has to be some kernel of usefulness in there. 
- In particular, I'm thinking of the [[The Wright Brothers by David]], who were thought crazy for so long until their ideas were proven. They'd already flown long before people believed they had. 
- The Wright brothers showed how fickle this perception can be when they went from universally ridiculed to admired in a day after people saw their flight. 


## Connections
- In an interesting connection, in [[King Leopold's Ghost]], many of his critics were looked upon as crazy. One of them committed suicide because of the intense scrutiny he faced. This connects with the idea that [[03132021 - Bad things happen slowly]]. People rarely notice what is going on and often don't want to because it requires changes to their #Worldivew, which as noted by [[Nudge by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein]] and [[The Righteous Mind by Jonathon Haidt]] is very hard.

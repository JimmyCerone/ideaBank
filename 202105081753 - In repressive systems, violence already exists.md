## Idea
- When people beg for "nonviolence" and decry violence, what they fail to note is that violence preceded that action. People don't want "nonviolence" they want no violence in reaction to their actions.
	- Many folks also have a constrained view of violence, failing to see [[202103131649 - Laws can be used violently by the majority or those in power]] & [[03-03-2021 - Language can be violent]]

## Example
> It is subordinate because it has to do with the "cost" of desired change–the question of the legitimacy of revolution is not decided on the basis of the legitimacy of violence and vice versa! Violence is a cost that must be estimated and pondered in relation to a particular revolutionary situation. It is "relative" because in most revolutionary situations ... violence is already a fact constitutive of the situation: injustice, slave labor, hunger and exploitation are forms of violence which must be weighed against the cost of revolutionary violence.11  It is this fact that most whites seem to overlook-the fact that violence already exists. The Christian does not decide between violence and nonviolence, evil and good. He decides between the less and the greater evil. He must ponder whether revolutionary violence is less or more deplorable than the violence perpetuated by the system.

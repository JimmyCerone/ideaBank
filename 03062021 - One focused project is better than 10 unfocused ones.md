## Context
- Part of the [[The Wright Brothers by David]] success was due to their single minded focus on one project above all others. They did have their bike shop, but other than that they were completely focused on flight. 

## Connections
- I think this might be related to [[03062021 - Innovators often look crazy until their ideas come to fruition]] because innovators are isolated by their work in some ways. This raises the #Question: Is innovation fundamentally lonely work? Lonely in the sense that it is isolated from the mainstream? Is that a cause or effect?
- I also find that this is related to the fact that [[03062021 - Innovations come in clusters]]. The theory is that by going deep into one #Problem, you find many solutions along the way. If you'd spread that energy out, you would find nothing. Neil and I might find this interesting. While we are doing lots of projects, we aren't spreading ourselves thin. Doing one project at a time might be a #Levers for this very reason.

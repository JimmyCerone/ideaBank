Learned this in [[202103291336 - The Episode of Everything - Balaji on Bitcoin]] and I'm now curious as to why we do have a standing army. 

Once again, similar to my misgivings with [[202104091309 - Journalists comprise a separate class in the US]], I'm not sure citizen soldiers are any better than an idea than a standing army of trained professionals. I'm not with Balaji here on the #Libertarian train I guess. That assumes #Power dynamics and #History play no role, which I think is naive.

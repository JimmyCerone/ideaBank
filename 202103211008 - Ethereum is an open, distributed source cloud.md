## Context
- Learned this while listening to [[202103211305 - Vitalik Buterin, Creator of Ethereum, on Understanding Ethereum]]. 

## Idea
- #Ethereum is like if the #Cloud were distributed across many individuals and computers instead of being under one private #Company like #Google or #Amazon

## Connections 
- In [[202103181651 - The Quiet Master of Cryptocurrency]], I learned about the #Blockchain in relation to #Cryptocurrency. #Ethereum is like the generalized version of blockchain. As Naval points out, this creates both more security risks and more opportunities. 
- Reminds me of my story, [[Coding as Building]]. This fits nicely in the analogy extension.

## Reflections
- I struggled with how to frame this problem after reading articles about bias in computer science and diversity in general. What most people are doing in these cases is [[042120211326 - Inductive Reasoning]]. They assume the "facts" and "reality" that they observe are unbiased without considering the historical roots of that reality. From these biased facts, they draw conclusions that they turn into general principles. The problem is they never question the "facts" they use. 
- For the case of computer science, most fail to consider this key question:
	- Why was computing originally balanced between the genders and what made it change? Books like [[A People's History of Computing by Joy Lisi Raskin]] attempt to answer this question, but few voices I've seen do the work to understand this #History.
	- If folks were required to use [[042120211326 - Deductive Reasoning]] their analysis would fall apart. You can't say that ALL men are better at programming than women. Nor can you say 90% of men are better and that's why the ratio is 9:1. If folks were required to start from true, generalized premises, then they'd be screwed. But they aren't so...

## Connections
- Both [[Black Power and Black Theology by James Cone]] and [[How to Be Antiracist by Ibram X. Kendi]] point this out as well, though not using the same words.
- When someone is using this type of #Logical argument, it's likely that they are more worried about group membership (see [[The Righteous Mind by Jonathon Haidt]]) than any type of truth.

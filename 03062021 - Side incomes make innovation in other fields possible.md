## Idea
- This idea seems closely intertwine with the idea [[03062021 - The first option is rarely the best option]]. The Wright brothers started a newspaper before their bike shop and Rockefeller was in many business before starting Standard Oil. I think a big problem with the #Startup and #ProductHunt communities right now is that you are encouraged to move fast and commit, when that isn't always in your best interest.


## Examples
- [[The Wright Brothers by David]] used their income from their bike shop to fund their flights. 
- [[Titan The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.]] used his income from Standard Oil to revolutionize #Philanthropy and #Giving as well as #Medicine
-  [[Ask Finny]] is kind of doing this within their #Business. They are trying out many #Streams of #Revenue to determine which works best.

## Context
- This is all about #Privacy. It is near impossible to have it, even in #Public. Yet it's increasingly troubling the amount of access Private Investigators and #Police have to your personal information. 
- Came across this idea while reading [[Surveillance Today]] and the following articles: 
	- https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/world/europe/the-sun-meghan-markle-harry.html
	- https://www.surveillance.today/actvists-sue-thomson-reuters-for-detailed-cradle-to-grave-dossiers/

## Connections
- What is weird about today's world is that it is no longer simply celebrities like [[Titan The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.]] or [[Hellbound on His Trail by Hampton Sides]] that have to worry about #Privacy. Everyone has to. In part because mistakes are super costly. You can have your #Credit blown up by a #Crime you didn't commit because of a #Data mistake in a #Database few know exist and is hard to trace.  
- Adds a dangerous element to the idea that [[202103221231 - Privacy is dead]].

> At first glance, you may be asking what this story has to do with surveillance. The answer is everything. This story highlights the ease with which rogue private investigators or law enforcement can use the information at their disposal to essentially stalk or ruin lives. Many people such as activists, politicians, and celebrities -- such as Meghan Markle -- go through great lengths to hide this information from the public, yet all those efforts can be all for not solely on a whim of a financially or emotionally motivated person.

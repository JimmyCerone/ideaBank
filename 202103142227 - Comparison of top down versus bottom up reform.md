Not sure where I land here. I am most comfortable with [[202103142225 - Top down is the best way to reform existing structures]] because it least affects a #System that benefits me yet feel it doesn't do enough. I think that #Marxist #Ideas and [[202103142226 - Bottom up is the best way to reform existing structures]] sometimes go too far, but on the whole I'm closer to believing this is the correct idea. Martin Luther King was stuck between these ideas, as I found in [[Hellbound on His Trail by Hampton Sides]], though he was shifting towards bottom up at the end of his life with Universal Basic Income and the #Poor People's Campaign.

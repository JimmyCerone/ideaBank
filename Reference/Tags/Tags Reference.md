#LowHangingFruit - An idea that we could quickly implement. 

#PhysicalProduct  - Well positioned for a CAD modeling.

#OneHundredIdeas - Ideas to submit for 100 ideas competition by [[Start Garden]]

#BadTiming - Anachronistic ideas like [[Masks are hard to breathe in]]

Readiness (per [[Psionica]]):
- #Lacking - Doesn't need refinement, it needs growth (to be combined with another idea or to be significantly modified)
- #Brainstorm - ideas that need more refinement that we can't or don't want to provide
- #Studio - Best fit for writing about and not doing (huge lift)
- #Lab - Quick and dirty experiment (How much does it cost?)
- #Workshop - Dual is [[Psionica]]'s workshop. Not quite production ready but able to be distributed.  

#InProgress  - An idea that is still in need of development

#ReadyToWrite  - Ready to write. 

#WizardOfOz - Do things that don't scale. Automate something by doing it yourself until it grows too large. 

#Hard - Very challenging to implement but an interesting thought. A significant change in [[03062021 - Levers]] could make this feasible. Generally good for #Brainstorm

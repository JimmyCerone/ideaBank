Readiness (per [[Psionica]]):

- #Studio - Best fit for writing about and not doing (huge lift)
- #Lab - Quick and dirty experiment (How much does it cost?)
- #Workshop - Dual is [[Psionica]]'s workshop. Not quite production ready but able to be distributed.  

#InProgress  - An idea that is still in need of development

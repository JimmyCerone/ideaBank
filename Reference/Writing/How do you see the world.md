Steve Jobs was an exacting man with an exacting view of the world. Everyone he worked for spoke of his “reality distortion field” which bent the world around him to his will. With both his tirades and his brilliance, Jobs made his World View, remarkably clear.

For those of us without personalities like Steve, our world view can be harder to detect. Whereas Jobs wore his world view like gaudy goggles one could hardly miss, many of us where contacts we scarcely detect.

We only know we are wearing our “World View” when our brother exasperates us by the way he spends his money, celebrities and their purchases baffle us, and saints like Mother T make us blush to compare ourselves to.

For a real world example of this conflicts of vision that illuminate our World View, check out Pam and Michael, whose World Views live on different planets.

Conflicting Worldviews in The Office

Michael is weird. And he sees the world in a weird way. We all know folks like Michael, and are probably like him ourselves in some way.

I, for example, use my finger to get all the yogurt out of the cup.

Is it gross? Yes.

Why do I do it? Because I loathe waste and value frugality over manners. Others (like my grandmother) feel _very_ differently.

It’s pretty clear to all of us that we see the world in a particular way and that way brings our actions to life.

What’s weird to me is that we rarely reflect on this lens that colors everything we do.

Unless, of course, we are in conflict with someone about how to properly eat yogurt or something equally monumental.

In this article I’m going to walk us through how to understand our own worldview, which will give us the power to change it.

### The Times They Are A Changing

Why do we need change? None of us deep down wants to spend the rest of our lives scraping the last bits of yogurt out with our fingers.

On a more serious note, I realized I needed this change because I came face to face with the reality that my World View was way off.

For a long time, I unconsciously considered social life a zero sum game. The social scene was then a kind of game where there are winners and losers and I always felt like one of the losers. When you lose enough (or feel you do), you quit playing the game. Last summer I stopped being social. I intentionally quit.

And it ate away at me. You lose something when you isolate. But, at the time, I felt I was losing more by playing the game. I was like a fish in water, constantly swimming around in my own perception of the world and blind to the wider world.

My worldview failed me. Ironically, in my self-imposed isolation I read a lot of books, and two helped me see my error. Scary Close by Donald Miller and The Village Effect by Susan Pinker helped me realize the flaws in my thinking and pushed me to reconsider what social life was. Was it a zero sum game or a place to build mutually supportive connections? Slowly, I began to realize it was the latter.

While reading an [article](https://medium.com/@SeanBlanda/the-other-side-is-not-dumb-2670c1294063) by Sean Blanda about how to discuss the views of “The Other Side,” I found a scientific word for my experience: “false consensus bias.” All my life I had figured that my views on social life were the consensus.

This bias has serious negative consequences for our discussion of worldview: we only really notice our worldview when it is under attack, causes us pain, or conflicts with someone else’s.

Therefore, our traditional experiences with worldview are inherently negative.

### Flipping the Script

> The key to changing our World View is changing how we relate to it.

We need to learn to think about it in a positive manner that encourages change rather than entrenchment.

One of the best ways I’ve found to discuss worldview in a respectful and productive manner comes from Blanda’s article I mentioned earlier:

> There’s a fun game I like to play in a group of trusted friends called “Controversial Opinion.” The rules are simple: Don’t talk about what was shared during Controversial Opinion afterward, and you aren’t allowed to “argue” — only to ask questions about why that person feels that way. Opinions can range from “I think James Bond movies are overrated” to “I think Donald Trump would make a excellent president.”

I love the rules of this game because I think they outline the important factors about discussions of worldview. People must feel safe expressing their opinion, they must feel valued, and they must trust you. Blanda’s game, played with good friends, assumes trust and through the rules creates a feeling of safety.

I found a more private and personal way to learn about worldview while reading the [Lean Startup by Eric Reis](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898). Reis encourages startups to constantly verbalize and test their assumptions with the goal of attaining “validated learning,” aka positive change. I think we can do the same with our own assumptions about life.

Writing down our assumptions brings enormous clarity to a cloudy cause of stress in our lives. To see, on paper, what assumptions are holding you back, changes the game we are playing. When I went back and did this with my social assumptions, it was amazing how foolish some assumptions seem. For example, here are a few:

-   You can’t ask people to hang out spontaneously, it must be pre-planned
-   Everyone else is perfectly happy with their social lives
-   Everyone else has great friends

You don’t even have to test those assumptions to know they aren’t true. But, until I verbalized them, they held me back from engaging with people.

I think these two practices I’ve outlined work hand-in-hand because reflecting on your assumptions allows you to achieve a better understanding of your own worldview, which in turn allows you to better discuss and internalize the worldviews of others.

So in summary, worldview is too important for us to ignore. While many of us have shitty experiences discussing worldview, we can improve our experiences by reflecting on our assumptions and discussing these assumptions among trusted friends.

Just got my stimulus check and I'm not sure what to do with it. 

Upcoming expenses:
- Car maintenance
- Phone fix (apple care)
- Taxes
- Hair cut
- Liv's birthday
- Engagement ring

Not sure what to do with the extra. Feel like I should donate it given the Singer article Tad told me about. Also feel like I want to put it into crypto [[How Can or Should I Get Involved in the Crypto Space?]]. Stuck there. Might put off this decision for now. 

I want to think about this in terms of percentages. Let's say do this: 

- Give Away 10% ($130)
- Invest 20% ($250)
- Ring 20% ($250)

One idea I had was to put away a certain percentage of it in investments that I could use to fund my habits. That's interesting, but could be costly tax wise. Also could lose the money. I could throw it in crypto. I could also just fully fund the ring fund and put that money elsewhere every month. Will have to think on this more.

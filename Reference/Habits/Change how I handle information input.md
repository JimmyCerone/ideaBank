Since I've started using [[Obsidian]] and other stuff, I've started to dread keeping up with my reading pace. There are two [[03062021 - Levers]] at work here that I'm struggling with (much like [[202103261011 - Knowledge management depends on reads and writes]]):
- Input
- Processing
- Output


## Input
- Lowest - no reading
- Medium - ~ 3 books at a time + some articles
- Highest - 1-2 books a day


- These days I have so much input. Audio books have changed how much input I can handle, 2X at least. What I'm finding is that [[202105022053 - There are timed and timeless texts]]. I'm working on [[Read uncommon sources of information]], which might be more efficient. But reading "deeply" as I think of it is exhausting. This blends into output. Almost like a middle path, like processing? 

### Questions / Heuristic
- How do I figure out what is a worthwhile input? 
	- Meta questions - what is the value I get out of this?
		- [[Read uncommon sources of information]] plays out here


## Processing

- Lowest = no notes or anything after reading, like [[Black Swan by Nassim Taleb]]. 
- Middle = article on an idea like I did when [[Writing daily]]
- Highest - what I did with [[Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World]]

### Questions / Heuristic
- How do I determine what to think more about? 
	- [[202105022053 - There are timed and timeless texts]] - what ideas are worth keeping? What ideas are uncommon?


## Output
- Lowest - None - haven't done this in a long time
- Middle - Probably where I'm at now, 1-2 articles a week
- Highest - [[Writing daily]].

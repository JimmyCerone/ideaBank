The more I think about the changing world after hearing [[202103291336 - The Episode of Everything - Balaji on Bitcoin]] and other sources, the more I consider how to future proof my career, the more I realize that original thoughts are going to be my unique value. How do you get unique ideas?

I think there are a few [[03062021 - Levers]]:
- Process information in unique ways ([[Obsidian]], [[Orbit]])
- Locate unique information (old - think [[Black Swan by Nassim Taleb]], or under known - think [[The Autobiography of Malcolm X by Malcolm X]] at least these days)
- Combine ideas in unique ways (reading multiple books at once, talking with disparate people)

That is going to be damn tough to automate. I think. Though it's possible. The challenge in automating that is finding a good choosing algorithm, what is an idea worth pursuing? I think that will take a while to determine for computers as humans are bad at it. 

Update as of [[2021-06-02]]:

- I think automation is the wrong approach because finding interesting articles is highly inefficient compared to finding interesting curators. An interesting curator is worth 1000 articles. So the real goal will be to find interesting people and find what they are reading, which is what makes [[Matter]] so special.

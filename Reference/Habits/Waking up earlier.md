## First Iteration
- Wake up 5 minutes earlier every week
	- Thought this was cool until I realized it would take me 20 weeks to get to 7 am...

## Second Iteration
- Found a middle ground. I felt like with the first iteration it was discouraging and limited me from trying to get up earlier, which I'd wanted to do. What I realized was that I could have the wake up time that drops 5 minutes a day as a "ceiling" - the latest I can get up. So I can get up earlier, but I can't get up any later (at least on a weekday). This approach is very low cost so I can do it while [[Exercising 5 days a week]] and it's becoming automatic fast. I'm just waking up at a better time naturally by now. So cool!

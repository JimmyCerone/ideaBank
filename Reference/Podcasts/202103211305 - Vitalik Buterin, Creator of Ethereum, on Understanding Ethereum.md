## Reflections
- Helped wake me up to the world of #Cryptocurrency - felt like a more useful podcast than [[202103181651 - The Quiet Master of Cryptocurrency]]. That podcast was great for understanding, but I don't think getting into crypto is gonna be worth it. Almost feels too late. Building for #Ethereum, on the other hand, feels like it has real legs.

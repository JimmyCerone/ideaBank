Literally covers everything. 

## Reflections
- I am conflicted here because I find the idea of [[202103282113 - Freedom entails responsibility]] coming up again because Balaji argues for completely free markets, which is dumb because [[202103291338 - Free market leads to monopoly]]. But many of his thoughts on #Cryptocurrency are interesting. 
- I was both fascinated and apalled by his take on the East Coast elite. Remarkably caustic. Wasn't sure quite how to respond to it. He hates [[03292021 - Cancel Culture]], which I disagree with and land more with my brother in [[202103291355 - Cancelling Cancel Culture]]. It almost felt QAnon like and just felt weird. I think he would disagree with [[03102021 - Not all tech is helpful]]. He's definitely a tech utopian, and [[Growth by Vaclov Smil]] would disagree with some of his ideas as well. Just weird. Requires lots more thinking, especially in light of [[Choosing to filter ideas rather than rejecting people]]. 
- He glorifies #Tech culture and dismisses critiques about tech bros in part because he believes he has the key to the #Meritocracy (which is kind of a myth). All this reminds me a lot of [[03132021 - The gospel of enterprise has been used for centuries to demean outsiders]] which scares me.

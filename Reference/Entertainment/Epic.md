An awesome movie chosen by [[Liv Panozzo]] and that we watched on [[2021-02-27]]. Loved it. 

## Reflections
- Deeply connected to #Nature with some interesting thoughts that connected to [[The Hidden Life of Trees]]. 
- Featured [[Beyonce Knowles]] and many others.
- A fascinating look at #Science mixed with fantasy. The father in the book reminded me of [[The Wright Brothers by David]] because they were also ridiculed for a looooong time while trying to fly.

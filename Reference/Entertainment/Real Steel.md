## Reflections
- I looooove this #Movie. There is nothing better than #HughJackman in a feel good bad to good movie, like [[Logan]]. 
- Fascinating in light of the strategies uncovered in [[Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World by Jack Weatherford]], as Jackman used so many interesting fighting tactics. 
- Also tons of connections with [[Superintelligence]] because the "winning" bot was an AI, but couldn't predict Jackman's boxing style because the AI hadn't been trained on that. 
- Connects to [[Range]] as well because it made me think about whether, with enough time, all learning environments could become kind. Boxing was definitely a wicked learning environment, which made it possible for Jackman to win. 
- Another weird thing was that the year was 2020 in the movie, and it made me reflect on how far we've come (and not) come. We nearly have autonomous #Cars, but no fighting robots as of yet. Those robots would come with many of the ethical gray areas, as pointed out in [[Superintelligence]], especially in light of the human they highlight in Atom.

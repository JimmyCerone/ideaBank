### Ideas
- There are lots of #Levers that are leading to increased disease spread
	- By decreasing wildlife #Habitats, many wild animals are moving closer to humans, increasing the chance of transmission.
	- Commercialized #Agriculture decreases #Biodiversity and increases transmission of disease. The diseases scale just as the #Food does.

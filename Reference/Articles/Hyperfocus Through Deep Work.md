Reading an article that produced [[202104081014 - Productivity is a function of efficiency times effectiveness]] and wanting to rethink the way I work. 

The guy interviewed there does [[040820211016 - Deep Work]] first then at lunch takes a break and reads the news, does admin tasks and random meetings. My day is almost the complete reverse. I check the news and do random stuff first. 

What if I used that micromanager app in the morning to keep me off of stuff like Hey? What if I woke up earlier? I feel like that is the best way to get into deep work is between 7:30 and 8:30. Could I wake up at 7 then start work at 7:30? What would that do for me? 

What's challenging is that the dude does deep work 8-10 PM, which is hard. I could probably fit in an hour in the evening. He talked about the use of routine to remove the need for willpower, which I love. 

Other interesting concepts are the focus on time vs quality of time (I tend to focus on quantity at work. How could I get out of that paradigm?)

Context switching is another one that I do a lot of that I need to work on. 

Could I punch 8 hours but work 4-5 deeply with the rest given to reading and stuff? Would that work? 

## Connections and Reflections

- Seems that [[Atomic Object]] is kind of designed to be anti-deep work. We use pair programming and follow [[Extreme Programming by Kent Beck]] which is all about collaboration and tons of interruption. There is no room for isolated thinking time (open office, etc). So these ideas are kind of at odds. At Atomic, this is a tool in your belt, not a process you do all the time. Not much of our work is "deep" in the sense that we are doing CSS and HTML and React. We aren't designing quantum computers and we aren't often solving novel problems.

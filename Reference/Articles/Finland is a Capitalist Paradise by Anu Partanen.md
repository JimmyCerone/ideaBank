## Summary
- Finland is better than America at doing #Capitalism because it provides a better competitive environment and better jobs. 
	- Just as business friendly as the US
	- Better protection of private property
	- Les impact on competition from gov controls
	- More openness to trade
	- High levels of economic mobility
	- Higher levels of personal and political freedom
- What US calls socialism could also be seen as basics required for business friendly nation (we are based on an industrialist system, this could be the update)
- [[03062021 - Levers]] at play here
	- Education (for my kids)
	- Retirement
	- Health Insurance
- The levers above are the 3 biggest and most important costs I face here in the US. Right now, I put away 60% of my salary, 30% to taxes and the rest going to the above. Why not just pay it to the government and have them take care of it in a more centralized, efficient way?

## Connections
- Reminds me of [[What We Can learn from a Big Boat Stuck in a Canal]] and [[New York State to Revolutionize Antitrust by Matt Stoller]]. The US is not a capitalist paradise, it's a monopoly paradise ([[202103291319 - Monopolies act as bottle necks]]
 & [[202103291338 - Free market leads to monopoly]])
 - All this means we might suck without knowing it.

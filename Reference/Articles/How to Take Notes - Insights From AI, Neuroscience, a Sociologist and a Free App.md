## Ideas
- Niklas Luhman Note-taking system
	- A German Sociologist who lived through WWII and published more than 70 books and 400 articles. Systems Thinker....
	- Creator of the Zettelkasten note-taking method
		> His famous system, the “slip box” or [Zettelkasten](https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125) note-taking method revealed how incredible he was: It incorporated ideas related to [modularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity), [hyperlinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink), and the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web) (but note that these concepts and ideas were either non-existent or very new at that time).
		- Implemented his system with note cards and based t off of #Atomic operations and links. 
			- Idea is that each note should be #Atomic containing one idea, no more, no less. I don't do this well...

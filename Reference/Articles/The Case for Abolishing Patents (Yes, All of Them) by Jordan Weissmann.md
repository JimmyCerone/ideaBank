## Summary
#### Problems with the Patent System
- Trolls can buy up patents and sue the crap out of people (low bar for patents)
- Patent protection grows inevitably stronger
	- This strength is driven by lobbyists who keep incumbents (and innovation) out
- Rising patent applications have no correlation to economic productivity ([[03102021 - The patent system inhibits innovation]])
	- An interesting [[03062021 - Levers]] that does not work to pull. Kind of damning. 
#### Argument for No Patents
- Patents only come after people have lost first mover advantage and pace of innovation has slowed
	- This means they are mostly defensive and therefore not super helpful
- Could protect some industries (like big pharma)
	- Seems like a terrible idea a la [[Punished by Rewards by Alfie Kohn]] only rewarding certain people


## Connections
- Connects with [[Zero to One by Peter Thiel]] in an interesting way. Thiel would (I'm guessing) argue patents are essential for maintaining #Monopoly. That said, he might, like the article says, argue that [[202103291338 - Free market leads to monopoly]] anyway so patents are simply dead weight. 
- [[Punished by Rewards by Alfie Kohn]] comes to the top of my mind as I read this because it almost seems as if monopoly's are a type of reward system for companies, which would mean they do inhibit innovation. 
- [[202103291319 - Monopolies act as bottle necks]] & [[202103290919 - Monopolies are not antifragile]] would tend to support the abolition of the patent system as that is one of the major [[03062021 - Levers]] that enables them. 

## Reflection
- Overall a rather weak article that sums up what I assume is a stronger one. That said, it doesn't leave me wanting to learn more about patent law, which I had lots of articles bookmarked about. Thank goodness I read the shortest one.

Smart critique of [[Slack]] and the source for [[202104200859 - Chat is a greedy form of communication]]. 

## Quotes
**The problem is that today’s chat tools are amplifying the troublesome parts of human nature, rather than minimizing them.**

-   We are impatient.
-   We feel anxiety for “unread” badges.
-   We are addicted to push notifications.
-   We think things are more urgent than they really are.
-   We care about our team’s perceptions and don’t want to look like we’re slacking off.

Don’t get me wrong, chat is not intrinsically bad. It’s part of what made Slack feel so magical at first, and it’s a key ingredient that is here to stay. The ability to engage with your team in real time is vital — but only when the discussion _must_ be synchronous.

Chat is a _greedy_ mode of communication.

-   It doesn’t care if you are deep in flow.
-   It begs you to incessantly clear its notification badges.
-   It buries important conversations among idle chatter when you snooze it.
-   It must be used with restraint or it becomes toxic.

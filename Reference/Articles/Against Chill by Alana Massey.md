A hilarious and poignant take on "chill". Never thought about it so deeply before. Weird manifestation of [[202104050849 - Offloading responsibility is manipulative]]. Kind of reminds me of the nice guy trope. 

Some interesting [[03062021 - Levers]] at work here. 

> To the uninitiated, having Chill and being cool are synonyms. They describe a person with a laid-back attitude, an absence of neurosis, and reasonably interesting tastes and passions. But the person with Chill is crucially missing these last ingredients because they are too far removed from anything that looks like intensity to have passions. They have discernible tastes and beliefs but they are unlikely to materialize as passionate. Passion is polarizing; being enthusiastic or worked up is downright obsessive. Excessive Chill is “You do you” taken to its most extreme conclusion, giving everyone’s opinions and interests equal value so long as they’re authentically ours.

In a weird sense, this intense form of chill is a form of #Libertarian of the worst degree. I almost prefer [[Nudge by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein]] here because there is at least some animating force. 

> Chill is different — it is agreeable because it is emotionally vacant. Chill is what Cool would look like with a lobotomy and no hobbies.

> Each decade since has seen an increasing interest in eschewing anything that might limit the free expression and experience of one’s interior life and carnal desires. But this kind of Chill still had an emotional dimension. Hippies coined the term “free love” rather than “free sex.” The pioneers who brought “open relationship” into the mainstream vernacular the early aughts to describe non-traditional partnerships still acknowledged that feelings were involved at some level. An open relationship is, after all, still a relationship.
> Chill has now slithered into our romantic lives and forced those among us who would like to exchange feelings and accountability to compete in the [Blasé Olympics](http://www.buzzfeed.com/alanamassey/in-defense-of-valentines-day) with whomever we are dating. Oh, I’m sorry, I mean whomever we are “hanging out with.” Whomever we are “talking to.” Chill asks us to remove the language of courtship and desire lest we appear invested somehow in other human beings.

Thought this might finally connect with [[202103282113 - Freedom entails responsibility]] and it does. Weird connections here between [[202103131919 - Christianity and capitalism are deeply intertwined]]. In a way, they are similar impulses. Let's all be free! They both say it. Just differently. They both aim to be stoic, just about different things. Huh. 

>But Chill is not the opposite of uptight. It is the opposite of demanding accountability. Chill is a sinister refashioning of “Calm down!” from an enraging and highly gendered command into an admirable attitude.

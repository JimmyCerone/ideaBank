## Summary
- How != Why
	- We can know how gravity works without knowing why it works. A subset of [[202104211317 - Inductive reasoning is often misused when addressing systemic problems]] and deeply related to [[Punished by Rewards by Alfie Kohn]] talk of rewards as a conservative force.
- Mathematics seems to work for explaining the world. Why does it? Why should it? 
	- Weird because math is part of what allows [[202104300003 - Human brains can contemplate unknown unknowns]], in part through [[03062021 - Levers]] (levers are really math applied to things)
- What is [[202105271921 - Math]]? 
	- Chains of close reasoning
	- Geometry
	- Numbers
	- Artistic taste
- The operations that work for integers work for real numbers and even complex numbers. 
	- Seems obvious but is super weird and unique
- [[202105271734 - Time invariance]]
- Why is math so effective?
	- We see what we look for
		- Classic [[The Righteous Mind by Jonathon Haidt]]
	- We select the kind of mathematics to use (and often have to invent it)
	- Science in fact answers comparatively few problems
		- We are no further to answer what is justice thanks to mathematics. Never considered this in our science steeped society.
	- The evolution of man predicted the model
		- Our ability to think is limited and transcribed, which makes it hard to think outside of our models ([[Black Swan by Nassim Taleb]] talks about this with extremistan)

## Critique
- Seems like it has strands of behaviorism and the numerification railed against in [[Punished by Rewards by Alfie Kohn]].

## Questions
- Why do such illogical creatures such as humans come up with and do so well with math?

## Quotes
> The enormous usefulness of the same pieces of mathematics in widely different situations has no rational explanation (yet).
	- Makes me want to return to math because it could help me understand [[Principles by Ray Dalio]] about the world.

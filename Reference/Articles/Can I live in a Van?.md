## Reflections
- I found this while on my tiny #House kick. I am starting to consider alternative housing options after understand how expensive owning one is. I kind of wish I could make the jump, yet I'm also unsure about it. At the moment, I'm feeling bad about not wanting to because it seems the frugal and "adventurous" thing to do but the more I learn about it the lifestyle sounds kind of terrible. I'd rather live in a bunch of random Airbnb's like Brian is doing. 

## Fun Facts
- Their costs associated with life on the road:
	- Food = $372 / person / month
	- Shelter (Place to Park)
		- Private RV Parks = $300 - $1200 / month
		- State + Nat Parks = $600 / month
		- National Forests = $450 / month
		- BLM Land = $0
		- Some free spots (you can do it illegally in the city and some states let you stay overnight at rest stops)
		- The most expensive places are often the least beautiful but have the most amenities. The cheaper beautiful places are often way out of the way. 
	- Utilities
		- $40 / month water
		- $5400 for solar system
		- $2-28 / month propane
	- Clothes 
		- $25 / person / month
		- Wear out faster on the road
- Health insurance is a nightmare because it is state based and if you plan on crossing state lines you are screwed. 
- Well shit. on top of all this you have the maintenance on the van itself. This is waaay more expensive and complicated than I initially thought. 
- Then there is the fact you live in a tiny space and all the smells are contained in one spot. Imagine everything smelling like #Blue all the time! This is not for me...

## Quotes
- This is insane, no idea how they managed this: 
> Over my 9 years of traveling, I’ve done it with any arrangement of just me and my girlfriend, our three kids, and even grandma and a dog thrown in there for a few years. So, I believe I have some insight into what life on the road is like, and I’d be more than happy to share some of that with you today.

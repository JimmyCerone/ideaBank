## Reflections
- What a great systematic look at what gives #AtomicObject it's unique value. Finally understand why we are colocated and generalists. 

## Ideas
- What a fascinating look at the #Levers that make us successful. 
> **Poly-skilled** – our teams mix developers and designers so that the team’s skills span the needs of the project in rough proportion to the size of the need.
   **Co-located** – our teams [work together](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2011/08/11/the-benefits-of-poly-skilled-co-located-project-teams/), side-by-side on a project, allowing people to pair on problems as necessary, so that all opportunities and constraints are balanced.
   **Generalists** – we hire people that have mastered or can quickly come up to speed in many areas, whether technical, strategic, or creative.
- A damn good explanation of the atomic #Braintrust and how it connects to our commitment to #Colocation
> This team organization is a microcosm of Atomic as a whole. It’s not uncommon that teams run into problems that no one on the team has the expertise to solve. Since AO is, itself, a poly-skilled, co-located team of generalists (though more poly-skilled and less extremely co-located than a project team), teams can draw on talent elsewhere at Atomic with nearly as much efficiency as pulling in a team member working on another feature.

-  A fascinating view of the way that our approach can be more efficient: 
> Consider a hypothetical organization with a software development team, a design team, and a marketing team, which is responsible for copy. The design team produces a design. The development team evaluates it, and begins implementation. While under development, part of the design is realized to be technically infeasible. The design team is notified, while the development team moves on to another part of the design. In the worst case, the development team gets blocked and wastes capacity. But in the best case they’re multitasking; dividing their attention between concerns and addressing neither optimally. Eventually the copy team is brought in to write copy that is too long or short for the design. A set of back and forth exchanges addresses the copy concerns via a combination of copy and design adjustments. But then the development team needs to implement the new design. Unfortunately, each team is split amongst multiple projects, and the developer or designer or copywriter who deals with an issue may not be the same one who worked on it originally, and their lack of context may introduce other problems because they violate other constraints with their proposed solution. These teams begin a limiting process to approach the desired equilibrium, but are thwarted by the latency between and interchangeability of their members, settling instead for a buggy, mediocre product.

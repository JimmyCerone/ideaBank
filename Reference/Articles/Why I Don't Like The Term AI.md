Fascinating take about the fuzziness of the definition of #Intelligence ([[202104120847 - Words aren't well defined]]) and how it shapes how we created #AI ([[03-03-2021 - Our language creates our reality]]). Reminds me of [[How to Be Antiracist by Ibram X. Kendi]] and the section he had about the development of IQ tests. 

What I find fascinating here though is a subtle point made about what AI is for if [[AI]] is not general, as Naval says in [[202103182008 - The Evolutionary Angel]]. If AI's advantage isn't that it's smart, then it's advantage is collaboration. [[Range]] comes into play here. An AI is useless if it's siloed in an increasingly complex world. The best path forward is then to create AI that helps people connect ideas, that communicates them in new ways. [[Psionica]] and [[Orbit]] are both doing this in markedly different ways. 

This approach leads to fascinating potential tools, like: 

> Synthetically curious: web crawling, stochastic search, query generation
    Synthetically hard-working: most automation systems
    Synthetically well-read: text processing, natural language processing (NLP), narrative analysis
    Synthetically knowledgeable: expert systems, commonsense reasoning
    Synthetically thoughtful: automated deduction? What about other kinds of thoughtfulness (e.g. consideration for diplomacy or emotional context?)
    Synthetically open-minded: // TODO
    Synthetically creative: See: ICCC conference
    Synthetically attentive to detail: most AI
    Synthetically analytical: static/dynamic analysis; NLP; image/sound processing...
    Synthetically careful: software verification
    Synthetically collaborative: mixed-initiative creativity tools; interactive theorem provers
    Synthetically empathetic: Affective computing? // TODO
    Synthetically articulate: narrative summarization; natural language generation?
    Synthetically good at listening: chatbots/dialogue systems, ideally // TODO

All this reminds me of [[Search engines cast too wide a net]] and our ideas about broad search. We might have something interesting here, like [[DevonTechnologies]].

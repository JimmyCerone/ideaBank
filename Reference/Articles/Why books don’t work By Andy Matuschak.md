## Summary

- [[03062021 - Levers]] involved in learning
	- Memory
		- Basic fluency with building blocks. If this isn't present, working memory is taxed and cognitive overload ensues
	- Understanding
		- Based off of metacognition skills like those taught in [[How to Read Literature like a Professor]]
	- Understanding of Understanding
		- Feedback about how well you understand something. Often lacking [[03042021 - Books are surprisingly bad at conveying knowledge, and readers mostly don’t realize it.]]. 

- Wrote the article with a problem first approach and an interesting movement from lectures to books to textbooks then on to the unknown

- Lectures don’t work ([[202105310953 - Transmissionism]])
    - [[03062021 - Levers]] 
        - Attention span
        - % Retention
        - Speed (much slower than reading)
- Books are like lectures (implicitly use of transmission without designing anything around a real model)
    - Books work when readers engage with them
        - Asking questions about the text
        - Verifying what they know about the text (memory / understanding of understanding)
    - Authors can help readers by generating questions (textbooks) but it doesn’t take us all the way (the course does a lot of the work)
        - Even here there is lots of meta cognition going on. How much should I do? How should I do it? When should I do it? 
        - Courses help with these [[03062021 - Levers]]
            - Social Learning
            - Feedback
            - Structure
            - Emotional Connection to material (often via professor)
- Learning Medium
    - Levers
        - Put basics in long term memory to lower working memory load
            - [[041120211358 - Spaced Repetition]]
    - Goal is for simply reading to equal understanding


## Connections
- [[Head First SQL]] seems to be an example of a book that doesn't simply assume a cognitive model and attempts to create one.

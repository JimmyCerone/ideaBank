## Reflection
- Surprised to see this and find it interesting. I would love to hear how the nonbinary #Community would react to something like this. Just fascinated by the concept. Reminds me as well of the #Lakota concept of a two soul person. 

## Ideas
- 5 Genders
	- _makkunrai_ - "male"
	- _oroani_ - "female"
	- _Calalai_ - biologically female, but take on male roles
	- _Calabai_ - biologically male, but take on female roles
	- _bissu_ - totality of gender spectrum

> Although their religious rituals and conception of gender are infused with pre-Islamic ideas, most Bugis are Muslims, many devoutly so. "There were complex interactions between Bugis values and Islamic teaching," explained Nasir. "This led to forms of Islamic-Bugis syncretism."
> For example, as Davies explained, Bugis people often seek out bissu to bless a forthcoming hajj to Mecca. Many calalai and calabai struggle with their sexuality and sense of self, she also noted, believing that their lifestyle (which may include same-sex relations) is sinful according to Islamic belief, but also that they are the way they are because it was prescribed by Allah. For the same reason, they do not have a concept of being born in the wrong body; even though some calabai may undergo cosmetic procedures to make them look more feminine, they will not consider themselves to be women, as Davies discovered in her fieldwork.
> "Bissu, calalai and calabai are experiencing a lot of stigma and discrimination, which is sadly increasing alongside the growing assertiveness of political Islam," said Nasir. "At the societal level, there is a strong tendency towards an increased piety and puritanism, which could be compared to that of born-again Christians in the West. The future for these persecuted people is not very promising."

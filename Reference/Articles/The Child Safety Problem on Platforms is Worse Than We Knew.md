## Summary
- Basically yet another example of [[202104050849 - Offloading responsibility is manipulative]] in the tech sector. First I learned about it in [[How the Personal Computer Broke the Human Body]] and now I'm learning more about it here. 
- Wild how bad the assumptions tech companies are making are. Basically absolve themselves of responsibility by assuming kids don't use their services.

- Many types of futures
	- Potential (all possibilities)
	- Preposterous (imaginable but ridiculous)
	- Possible ("might happen")
	- Plausible (could happen)
	- Probable
	- Preferable
		- Subcategory of not-preferable
	- Projected
	- Predicted
- The future is like a flashlight
	- The stuff we think will happen is bright while the stuff we can't even imagine (beyond a [[Black Swan by Nassim Taleb]]) is dark and outside of our range

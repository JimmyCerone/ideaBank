Fascinating connection to [[Brain Computer Interface]] in the realm of #VideoGames. In a typical Newel move, unlike [[Neuralink]] he's building an #OpenSource version of a BCI, which is both fascinating and sketchy. 

## Key Takeaways
- #Emotion can both be measured and manipulated using a BCI. 
- Early application of BCI tech would be sleep enhancement. 
- Everything will become software. Prosthetics for example, can be based on gaming software because they have to simulate so much anyway
- Relates in weird ways to [[Medicine]] and the #Neuroplasticity of the #Brain because you could add a prosthetic like a tenticle and the brain could learn how to use it. 
- A negative impact here would be that you could cause people #Pain beyond what their physical body deals with. 
	- Another one is that you could literally hack someones brain. Kind of #Dystopian but you could even hack a whole population, which would be bad. Autonomous #Cars have some of the same issues. That's why node based tech that is independent and not centralized (unlike the cloud) like [[Blockchain]] are so important. 
- All these advancements will be pending certification. The science is already done. 
- Just insane take here: 
	> "You're used to experiencing the world through eyes," Newell said, "but eyes were created by this low-cost bidder that didn't care about failure rates and RMAs, and if it got broken there was no way to repair anything effectively, which totally makes sense from an evolutionary perspective, but is not at all reflective of consumer preferences.
	> "So the visual experience, the visual fidelity we'll be able to create â€” the real world will stop being the metric that we apply to the best possible visual fidelity.

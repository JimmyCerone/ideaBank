## Reflections
- I've wanted to read this article for a long long time. I love it. Such an interesting idea. But, after reading response article I'm a tad more skeptical. I am thinking of this idea less as the be all end all and more as a low risk investment a la [[Black Swan by Nassim Taleb]]. The wider market is the many small bets you make while your X true fans give you a consistent income. 
- I really love this quote and hope it sinks in. It seems a balm to my soul that is hoping for fame: 
	> Instead of trying to reach the narrow and unlikely peaks of platinum bestseller hits, blockbusters, and celebrity status, you can aim for direct connection with a thousand true fans. On your way, no matter how many fans you actually succeed in gaining, you’ll be surrounded not by faddish infatuation, but by genuine and true appreciation. It’s a much saner destiny to hope for. And you are much more likely to actually arrive there.

## Connections 
- This article has [[03062021 - Levers]] written all over it. 
- What's interesting is that it connects to [[How Can Free Markets and Privacy Coexist?]] in a fresh way. This is the consequence of a lack of privacy, in a sense. Or is it? Can you have 1000 true fans and still have privacy? Fascinating question. Could be an interesting and exciting corollary of [[202103221231 - Privacy is dead]] 
- An interesting contrast to [[202103131820 - Private companies are militaristic]]. This business model seems #Community oriented and wholesome.

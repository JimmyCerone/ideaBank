In the past I've used #NegativeReinforcement tools like Stickk, but it didn't work for meditation. I'm not sure why it worked for writing, but not for meditation. But such is life. 

So, I'm kind of doing a tiered reward system for meditation:
- For every day of meditation I get a fun drink
- For every month of meditation I get to buy something fun. This month, I'm between:
	- Hey.com
	- Kindle 
	- Boox
	- Everydollar

I am still in process here. It's a choice I'm trying to make with my email list (see [[April 2021]] and [[March 2021]]) of friends and collaborations (which weren't as fun as I thought they'd be - lots of overhead). Not sure practically how to do this. I think it'd be good to sit down with some [[03062021 - Levers]] here and hammer this out. I think I'm most afraid of coming across as arrogant but really I'm just super excited to share my #Ideas.

Result of a conversation with my dad where he made a nice analogy between #SocialMedia and real social networks. There is this rather pernicious idea social media is a place to learn about the other side and become more balanced but [[The Righteous Mind by Jonathon Haidt]] showed that doesn't work (makes you more intolerant in fact) [[202103291156 - Social media is not a place to learn about the "other side"]].

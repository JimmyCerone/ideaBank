There is the troubling fact that abhorrent people can come up with decent ideas. I am struggling to find ways to accept interesting ideas while not affirming other ideas held by the author. Peter Thiel is a great example. I disagree with much of what he's done and how he does it, but believe he has some interesting ideas about startups. [[The Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz]] is another example. Have to be very careful about this, as it's a fine line. Reminds me of deep cover in [[Burn Notice]]. 

This decision is actually aligned with [[Choosing to begin curating my social feeds]]. That may seem surprising, but I think that by filtering my social feed I can leave more time to read things I disagree with rather than simply raging against them. Now that requires choosing to read challenging material, but I think I can make that happen.

I'm increasingly dissatisfied with spending #Money on #Food and #Drink. I'm not saying that I dislike good food and drink, but I made a few bad #Assumptions about it: 
1. Good food is expensive
	- Some of my favorite meals with [[Liv Panozzo]] were made with food from Aldi! With cheap #Wine from there, too!
2. More food / drinks is better
	- When I bought the flights of drinks, it was fun, but not lasting. It is much more fun to try 1 drink at a time (and much less expensive, too). 
3. #Restaurants Are 2-3X Better than Homemade
	- In the past, I went out to restaurants wanting better food. Now, I'm reconsidering. You can make cheap, good food at home. And I'd almost rather spend more money on fresh food than restaurant food because it IS way better. 

Things I missed:
1. Food Happiness is Short Lived
	- Food and drinks are good for short periods of time (for most things). In fact, the relationship is #Inverse. The better the food, the shorter you have it. 


Going forward, I want to spend more #Money on fresh food and save #Money at the end of the month for higher value items with long time horizons. So I'd rather spend more money on food everyday, but less overall.

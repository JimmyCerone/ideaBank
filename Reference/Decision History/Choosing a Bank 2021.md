I'm creating this document as a result of [[Principles by Ray Dalio]], which recommended it. 

This year, with Simple Bank shutting down, I had to find a new bank. 

My priorities were:
- #Buckets so I could organize my savings
- App / good website
- Well established (so I didn't have to find a new bank again)

I thought hard about including interest rates here but was kind of convinced out of it by my parents who said it wouldn't change much. But in the end, Ally bank still had a good interest rate.

I was between One Bank (a VC backed startup) and Ally in the end. Both had pockets and good apps, but One Bank was new and not well established liked Ally #Bank which is an industry leader. 

Assumptions: 

- The #InterestRate of my savings and checking accounts won't matter enough to pay attention to
- By keeping buckets, I can spend my money with less fear and get more value
	- The goal of buckets is to get me to spend more on things that matter

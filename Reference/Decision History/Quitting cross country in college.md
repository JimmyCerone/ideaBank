Made this decision for a few reasons:
- I was depressed
- The team culture was not good
	- The "bracket" the year before
	- Coach Kyle leaving (big part of the reason I came)
	- No focus on "JV"
	- Weird protein powder situation and favoritism
- My friends were in Durfee, not on the team
- Running made school very, very hard

## Reflections
- This is the first time I've thought this, but I'm very glad I quit. Hope running was not a good situation for me or for anyone really. [[Joey Dawson]] actually ended up getting worse from high school as a runner. Not a good program.

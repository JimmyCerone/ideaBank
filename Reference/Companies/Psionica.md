A wild company that built Dual. 

# Semantica

A project from Psionica that refers to mental models. Hard to distill these ideas, so so hard. They bend my brain. I don't want to simply quote them, but I find myself doing so. I've had these ideas tucked away for weeks, waiting to try to figure out how to talk about them. But I guess I'm just going to have to go for it. 

They say it best: 

> What if we could build tools which enabled us to work with concepts in a similar way Photoshop enables us to work with images? What if we could build tools which extend our conceptual thinking beyond what is humanly possible? Instead of blending colors, we would combine concepts. Instead of creating gradients, we would explore continua of meaning. Instead of defining intricate visual patterns, we would define systematic patterns of meaning.

So far ahead of it's time I've never even considered it. I still can barely understand it, but I can't wait for [[Neil]] and I to start using their tools and even building on them. 

Seems to be broken on their demo... Interesting and a bummer. 

## K-Probes

> Given how effective the child is in challenging the parent’s knowledge, could we promote critical thinking by embedding her behavior into a tool for thought? Could we incentivize people to actively reflect on their own beliefs by allowing them to converse with a “curious” machine? Even if the user wouldn’t actually receive new information in the exchange, the very act of highlighting gaps in their knowledge might be valuable. Such a tool could be used to challenge faulty beliefs, incentivize deeper understanding, and make assumptions salient.

Could be interesting for changing people's beliefs, though doing this in the context of relationships seems to be most helpful given [[Rising Out of Hatred by Eli Saslow]]. 

This will be hyper useful as I contribute to my knowledge base on fields like [[AI]] and [[Medicine]]. 

## Memory Navigator

- Basically building your own [[Google]] for your life through journals. An extension of Dual.

## Strengths
- Atomic is not about #Efficiency on purpose because it is focused on quality, not speed our quantity.
	- Our motto is "great custom software" not "fast custom software"
		- The cost of quick software that's "efficient" is maintenance
		- The goal here is also to solve the right problem, not the wrong one quickly.
	- It doesn't mean we don't care about efficiency, but the efficiency is less important than quality. 

## Questions
- Can the Atomic model be exported to other industries, like shipping? [[What We Can learn from a Big Boat Stuck in a Canal]].

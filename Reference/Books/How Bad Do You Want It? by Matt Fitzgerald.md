## Context
- First started this book a looong time ago while #Running cross at #Hope. Coach Northius gave us photocopied versions of the first and last chapters and I loved it. Oddly though this book was part of the reason I ended up [[Quitting cross country in college]]. I realized I didn't want it that bad. On the second read, things seem different. I think I'm realizing the potential for growth and increased awareness that can come from running. It can be a way for me to train myself and my brain to be more patient and present. That is tremendously motivating. So I might just start running again because of this book. 


## Reflections
### The Writing Style
- I have no idea how the author did it, but his writing style was so engaging. I am not sure if he went back and watched old tape or what, but the way he captured the excitement of old races was memorizing. Just so so good. 
### The Firewalk
- The central metaphor of this book is based on the idea that [[202103201751 - Stimulating muscles requires mental effort]]. If the limits are not #Physical, then they are mental and based on how much pain you can take. The author then likens a race to a firewalk, where your physical limit is the end of the hot coals. You never reach there, but only try to get closer and closer to it via the idea that [[202103201743 - Coping skills can be developed]].

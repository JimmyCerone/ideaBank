## Ideas
- The most poignant idea is that fundamentally, [[202104140854 - Christianity's primary purpose is liberation]] -> Black Power is about liberation -> Black Power is the "church" -> White church is not the church (not for liberation)
	- This is a clarifying lens to look at the word through. 

## Connections
- Lots of these ideas pop up in [[How to Be Antiracist by Ibram X. Kendi]]. I bet many of them are actually sourced here - cool to see their origin though they are interesting in the fact that Cone has them tied to #Religious and Kendi does not.

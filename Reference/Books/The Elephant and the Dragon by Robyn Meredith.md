A book about the #Economics of India and China as they transformed in recent years. 

## Reflections

### Forms of #Economics and #Government
- I found this book overly positive when it came to the virtues of #Competition. I felt that the book was specific in it's critiques against #Communist #Government and #Nationalist governments / anti-industrial governments, which is good. Often times critiques against other forms of government are general and weak, [[202103181937 - Straw man argument]]s as [[Joe Harder]] and I spoke about. That said, they were overly fair with #Capitalism. They noted the inequality and unfairness it created only in the context of the #Wealth it created for some without considering that maybe the two were linked. I'm not saying that capitalism is inherently unfair (yet), but the that didn't even seem to cross the authors mind. 

### Historical Context
- I knew so little about #China and #India and still do. This book woke up a desire to learn more about #History around the world (and from different perspectives) in me. For example, I had no idea that the #Indian #Economy was closed to the world until 1991, or that Ghandi was anti industry! Similarly, I had no idea that #China's #College system was shut down during the #Commnist reign and is only just now coming back. 

### Global Trends
- This book woke me up to the fact that change is coming, and fast. India and China are graduating huge numbers of students and skilling up fast. The workforce will likely get increasingly competitive. This idea revealed my bias against non-white americans because I had a difficult time imagining people from other countries beating me out for a job. My first reaction was to think that was unfair, even as it is becoming reality. That scared me because I worry I'm not skilled enough. Reminds me though of [[202103182008 - The Evolutionary Angel]] and the need to build a personal brand.

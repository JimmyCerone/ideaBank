  - > The solution to a weakening of tribal sovereignty post-1996 has been to employ political strategies that are more akin to those of other governments within the U.S. federal system: cities, counties, and states. (location: 220)


  - > However, in 2004 the Northern Arapaho Tribe won their federal court case against the state of Wyoming, the district court ruling that the state had acted in bad faith for refusing to negotiate, which allowed the Arapaho to strike a compact with the Department of the Interior. (location: 283)


  - > They also employ both “inside” and “outside” political strategies (Walker 1991) in a sophisticated, strategic manner. With the substantial economic interest in gaming as a catalyst and because of the often unfavorable view of gaming, tribal governments are seeking access to non-Indian political institutions, such as state governments, as never before to expand and protect their interests. We analyze the hypothesis that as the First Nations become wealthier, they will employ more calculated political tactics, similar to those of interest groups that have more longevity in the political system. For reservation governments, this is matter of survival for their people. (location: 288)

  - > Legally, there “should be mechanisms to prevent people from falling prey to scavengers” (pers. interview, January 28, 2008). (location: 345)


  - > Politics then, is cross-tribal. An advantage to this, which disadvantages academics trying to study such efforts, is that it helps to hide lobbying costs from prying eyes (pers. interview, January 28, 2008). (location: 349)


  - > Ultimately, the economic development and self-sufficiency of Indigenous peoples should be seen as a positive for both reservation interests and the American people at large, since the result will be less dependence on the U.S. federal and state governments. (location: 357)
    So sumilar to prevois args

  - > The first can be characterized as the intergovernmental politics model, which focuses on issues related to sovereignty, federalism, and political behavior in this context. The second is the public policy model. This view tends to focus on social policies and economic development for tribes within states. (location: 360)


  - > “Tribes, though more sophisticated in their use of the political tools available to them, must nonetheless be vigilant in responding to the demands of other powerful actors in that system. Indian tribes have always been at risk when the avaricious urges of the nation desired their natural resources, whether they be land, water, minerals from the earth, or gambling” (Mason 2000, 236). (location: 378)


  - > David E. Wilkins (1998) argues that devolution has unnecessarily complicated the relations between states and reservations and that the federal government should reclaim its role as the “lone constitutional authority to deal with indigenous nations” (Wilkins 1998, 55). This would certainly simplify things, and it is technically the most constitutional argument, but it is not likely to happen in the current political environment. (location: 386)


  - > Boehmke and Witmer (2004) compare competing models of policy diffusion in an attempt to understand state political behavior related to gaming operations. They contrast ideas of social learning and economic competition to see which is the better indicator of state cooperation with reservations involving the establishment of gaming compacts and casino operations.

  - > Baumgartner and Jones (1993) describe the interest group politics environment as a system of “punctuated equilibrium” where patterns of interaction remain more or less the same until something radical happens to transform the system, such as major campaign finance reform. (location: 402)


  - > By mobilizing citizens behind normative and material goals, and probably also by sheer accident of geography, cities can be viewed as behaving like all three types of interest groups—solidary (social), purposive (normative or ideological), and material (economic)—as described by James Q. Wilson (1973). While cities, as active institutions, may search for favorable venues within the federal system to help realize their goals, the question for this work is: can Indigenous reservations be considered in the same light? (location: 418)


  - > While they typically resemble local governments in form and function, they are also nations. Many of their developmental activities are akin to nation-building (Harvard Project 2008). Indigenous tribal governments already exist for solidary reasons,7 have purposive ideals, and have the same need to balance revenues with services as typical local governments in the United States. The advantage reservations have over cities is that federally recognized tribal governments and reservations have sovereignty. This makes them more like states than cities. However, sovereignty within the U.S. federal system is a double-edged sword. States are now claiming jurisdiction over tribal areas that have historically been the sole realm of Congress and the federal government. Part of what Baumgartner and Jones are suggesting here is that as “new ways of understanding old political problems take hold, different policymakers and government institutions suddenly begin to claim jurisdiction over issues that previously had not interested them” (1993, 4). We suggest there are several instances of punctuated equilibrium as it relates to First Nations and various policy areas, all of which affect current gaming politics and the semisovereign status of reservation governments.

  - > His analysis of tribal governance focuses on treaties, defined as contracts between nations, rather than on some notion of tribal subservience to the U.S. federal system. Enforcing and negotiating treaties falls under the plenary powers of Congress. These powers can sometimes be interpreted as exclusive domain over Indian affairs, the ability to preempt state laws under the commerce clause, and those functions that fall uniquely to the Congress itself (Ortiz 2002).

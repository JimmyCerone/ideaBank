  - > Poverty is created by barriers; we have to get around or break down those barriers to deliver solutions. But that’s not all. The more I saw our work in the field, the more I realized that delivery needs to shape strategy. The challenge of delivery reveals the causes of poverty. You learn why people are poor. You don’t have to guess what the barriers are. As soon as you try to deliver help, you run into them. (location: 657)


  - > We tend to push out the people who have qualities we’re most afraid we will find in ourselves—and sometimes we falsely ascribe qualities we disown to certain groups, then push those groups out as a way of denying those traits in ourselves. (location: 691)


  - > “I’m not in that situation because I’m different.” But that’s just pride talking. We could easily be that person. We have all things inside us. We just don’t like to confess what we have in common with outsiders because it’s too humbling. It suggests that maybe success and failure aren’t entirely fair. And if you know you got the better deal, then you have to be humble, and it hurts to give up your sense of superiority and say, “I’m no better than others.” (location: 695)


  - > Saving lives starts with bringing everyone in. Our societies will be healthiest when they have no outsiders. (location: 703)


  - >  (location: 868)
    This is terrifying.

  - > The US is doing the opposite of what the Philippines and the UK did. It is using policy to shrink the conversation, suppress voices, and allow the powerful to impose their will on the poor. (location: 1139)


  - > And, according to MenCare, stay-at-home dads show the same brain-hormone changes as stay-at-home moms, which suggests that the idea that mothers are biologically more suited to taking care of kids isn’t necessarily true. (location: 1692)


  - >  (location: 1814)
    Me too haha

  - > A huge part of what made an equal partnership appealing to Bill is that it’s a much more fun and challenging way of being in the world. In the end, though, I think Bill was meant for an equal partnership because it aligns with his deepest values. (location: 1822)


  - > What is hierarchy but a way to escape your share of the responsibilities? (location: 1927)


  - > “To be known without being loved is terrifying. To be loved without being known has no power to change us. But to be deeply known and deeply loved transforms us.” (location: 1942)


  - > Killian’s insight helped me realize that a big part of the work I do to support women and girls has to be my inner work—facing my own fears and flaws. She helped me see that I cannot stand for gender equality in the world unless I have it in my marriage. (location: 1947)


  - > the benefits of women’s power—not just what women can do that men cannot, but a quality of relationship that comes in an equal partnership that cannot come in a hierarchical relationship: a sense of bonding, of belonging, of community, solidarity, and wholeness born of a promise that I will help you when your burdens are high, and you will help me when your burdens are low. (location: 1958)
    For the love of men

  - > He loves to learn. Yes, he challenges people very hard, sometimes too hard, but he listens and learns, and when he learns, he is willing to shift. This passion for learning is not just Bill’s approach; it’s mine as well. It’s the central pillar of the culture we’ve tried to create at the foundation, and it explains how we all—some faster than others—came to agree that gender equity should drive the work we’re all trying to do. (location: 2373)


  - > How can you hold your strategy lightly, so you’ll be able to hear the new idea that blows it up? (location: 2408)


  - > Some parts of the Church come from God, and some parts come from man—and the part of the Church that excludes women comes from man. (location: 2586)


  - > A year and a half into the job, I started thinking about quitting. It wasn’t the work or the opportunities; they were awesome. It was the culture. It was just so brash, so argumentative and competitive, with people fighting to the end on every point they were making and every piece of data they were debating. It was as if every meeting, no matter how casual, was a dress rehearsal for the strategy review with Bill. If you didn’t argue strenuously, then either you didn’t know your numbers or you weren’t smart or you weren’t passionate. You had to prove you were strong, and this is how you did it. We didn’t thank each other. We didn’t compliment each other. As soon as something was done, we took little time to celebrate. (location: 2715)


  - > I’ve heard that you never actually meet a great friend; you recognize her. (location: 2749)
    Neil!

  - > That was a lesson for me. Men also face cultural obstacles in the workforce that keep them from being who they are. So anytime women can be ourselves at work, we’re improving the culture for both men and women. (location: 2798)


  - > An abusive culture, to me, is any culture that needs to single out and exclude a group. It’s always a less productive culture because the organization’s energy is diverted from lifting people up to keeping people down. It’s like an autoimmune disease, where the body sees its own organs as threats and begins attacking them. One of the most common signs of an abusive culture is the false hierarchy that puts women below men. (location: 2882)


  - > And we get isolated from one another more than men do—so it can take women a long time to realize that the bad fit we’re feeling is not our fault but a fact of the culture. (location: 2888)


  - >  (location: 2891)
    Confirmation bias.

  - > some employers used the hiring process to identify candidates who showed a “disinterest in people” and disliked “activities involving close personal interaction.” That screened out many women. (location: 2909)


  - > Another challenge is the low percentage of women in venture capital, which is even lower than the percentage of women in the computer industry. Venture capital is a crucial source of funding for entrepreneurs who are just starting a business and can’t afford a bank loan. (location: 2918)


  - > Nobody can think this makes economic sense. Women are going to have a ton of great business ideas that men are never going to think of. Unfortunately, “Who will have the most exciting business ideas?” is not the question driving the decisions. (location: 2923)


  - >  (location: 2930)
    This is insane...

  - > This isn’t charity on my part. I expect a good return, and I’m confident I’ll get one because women are going to see markets that men won’t see, and black and Latina and Asian women will see markets that white entrepreneurs won’t see. (location: 2931)


  - > Diversity is the best way to defend equality. (location: 2949)


  - > it matters who writes the code. (location: 2957)


  - >  (location: 2973)

  - > I am not saying that women should be given positions in tech that they haven’t earned. I’m saying women have earned them and should be hired for them. (location: 2979)


  - >  (location: 2992)
    Damn that’s wild...

  - >  (location: 3001)

  - > This angle seems to be supported by another line of research, one suggesting that women’s reticence comes not from a lack of confidence but from a calculation. A 2018 Atlantic article cites a study that says women with self-confidence gained influence “only when they also displayed … the motivation to benefit others.” If women showed confidence without empathy or altruism, they faced a “‘backlash effect’—social and professional sanctions for failing to conform to gender norms.” It’s fear of this backlash, according to another study, that keeps women from asserting themselves.

    Same

  - > When I start to feel inadequate and my perfectionism hits, one of the things I do is start gathering facts. I’m not talking about basic prep; I’m talking about obsessive fact gathering driven by the vision that there shouldn’t be anything I don’t know. And if I tell myself I shouldn’t overprepare, then another voice tells me I’m being lazy. Boom. (location: 3021)


  - >  (location: 3028)
    Wow. This is really hitting home.

  - > When I reflected later, I realized that maybe my best self is not my polished self. (location: 3042)


  - > If I haven’t helped to create a culture in my own organization where all women and men can find their voice, then I haven’t yet found my voice. (location: 3046)


  - > set up on the assumption that employees had partners who would stay home to do the unpaid work of caring for family and tending to the house. (location: 3057)


  - > We were in that short period of early adulthood when almost nobody needed us, so nothing got in the way of work. And this young man was an especially high performer. So I think he was worried. He was caught between his family and his job, and he loved both. I think he was hoping that if he told me what was going on, I wouldn’t hold it against him when the crisis hit and his performance dropped because he was loyal to his brother and wanted to spend time with him. (location: 3079)


  - > The United States is one of only seven countries in the world that do not provide paid maternity leave—joining the company of Papua New Guinea, Suriname, and a handful of other island nations. This is startling evidence that the United States is far behind the rest of the world in honoring the needs of families. (location: 3096)


  - > And when men take leave, the redistribution of household labor and caretaking lasts after they return to work. (location: 3103)


  - > A male-dominated culture is more likely to emphasize paid leave’s near-term costs and minimize its long-term benefits. (location: 3105)


  - > but if you’re not repeating yourself by the end of your life, you haven’t yet figured out what’s true. (location: 3123)

  - > The first time I suspected a link between feeling our grief and finding our voice, I thought, No way. If you need to feel your grief to find your voice, then why do people who can’t take pain without passing it on have such loud voices? Then it dawned on me: There is a big difference between a loud voice and a strong voice. (location: 3356)


  - > “When I am hurt, when I am in pain, when I am angry with someone for what they have done to me, I know the only way to end these feelings is to accept them.” (location: 3367)


  - > Letting your heart break means sinking into the pain that’s underneath the anger. (location: 3370)


  - > Every society says its outsiders are the problem. But the outsiders are not the problem; the urge to create outsiders is the problem. Overcoming that urge is our greatest challenge and our greatest promise. It will take courage and insight, because the people we push to the margins are the ones who trigger in us the feelings we’re afraid of. (location: 3387)


  - > It’s not easy to transform a culture built on exclusion. It’s hard to cooperate with people who want to dominate. But we don’t have a choice. We can’t just make the insiders into the new outsiders and call it change. (location: 3423)


  - > The supreme goal for humanity is not equality but connection. People can be equal but still be isolated—not feeling the bonds that tie them together. Equality without connection misses the whole point. (location: 3431)


  - > It ends the urge to push the other out. That is the goal. The goal is not for everyone to be equal. The goal is for everyone to be connected. The goal is for everyone to belong. The goal is for everyone to be loved. (location: 3436)


  - > So Sanare broke Maasai tradition and walked to the well to get water. Later, he bought a bicycle and biked the distance to the well. The other men mocked him for doing women’s work. They said he was bewitched by his wife. But Sanare was tough. He didn’t budge. He knew his new chore would make his son healthier and make his wife happier, and that was enough for him.

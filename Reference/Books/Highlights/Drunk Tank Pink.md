  - > Racial labels are so powerful that we’re incapable of judging skin tone accurately in their presence. (location: 457)


  - > It’s actually very difficult to judge intelligence objectively, especially when the evidence is mixed or inherently ambiguous. (location: 461)


  - > By convention, world maps place the Northern Hemisphere above the Southern Hemisphere, though there’s no inherent reason to equate cardinal direction with vertical position. Greek astronomer Ptolemy decided that maps should place north above south, possibly because the known world was clustered in the Northern Hemisphere. (location: 493)


  - > The reason: the northbound trip seemed “uphill,” requiring more effort and possibly more gas. (location: 499)


  - > In other words, when you ask English-speakers to indicate how much they like real words (or even nonsense words like plink or sarf), they tend to prefer the words with more right-hand letters than left-hand letters. (location: 520)


  - > One angry white viewer scolded Elliott for exposing white children to the discrimination that black children face every day. Black children are accustomed to the experience, the viewer argued, but white children were fragile and might be scarred long after the demonstration ended. Elliott responded sharply by asking why we’re so concerned about white children who experience this sort of treatment for a single day, while ignoring the pain of black children who experience the same treatment across their entire lives. (location: 556)


  - > The first and second graders who were labeled as bloomers outscored their peers by 10–15 IQ points. (location: 580)


  - > Linguist Stephen Levinson visited the Guugu Yimithirr people in the 1980s and described a series of interactions that showed just how differently the Guugu Yimithirr think about physical space. (location: 611)


  - > the Pormpuraaw describe time as flowing like the sun: from east to west. When a Pormpuraawan faces north, time flows from right to left, but when she turns to face south, time flows from left to right. (location: 617)


  - > When the accidents were sensationalized, the cars seemed to be traveling faster: in the minds of viewers, a “smashed” car must have been traveling faster than a merely “contacted” (location: 638)


  - > But the experimenters had devised a clever twist: when the makeup artists said they were applying a cream to ensure the scar wouldn’t fade, they were actually removing the scar with makeup-removal cream. By the time the students began interacting with their partners, their faces were no more flawed than they had been when the experiment began. Still, the label had already done its work: the students were convinced that their partners couldn’t stop staring at their scars, and in response their own behavior jeopardized the success of the interaction. The students’ partners agreed: though they weren’t told whether the student believed he had been scarred or merely described as allergy-prone, they were able to tell almost immediately which students were led to believe they were scarred. (location: 666)


  - > Women under pain of hysteria became second-class patients, and physicians often ignored legitimate complaints that warranted treatment. (location: 684)


  - > In fact, until the Nazi Party co-opted the symbol, it represented a range of innocuous mystical concepts. To Buddhists, the symbol represented eternity, to some Hindus the shape represented the god Ganesha, and to the Panamanian Kuna Yala people it represented the octopus that created the world. These positive connotations are reflected in its name, which comes from the Sanskrit word for “lucky” or “auspicious.” (location: 719)


  - > Merely exposing people to a symbol that implies creativity for less than a tenth of a second can cause them to think more creatively, even when they have no idea that they’ve seen the symbol. (location: 783)


  - > Part of the reason why the illuminated lightbulb primes insightful solutions is that the symbol has one very dominant meaning: the generation of an idea. (location: 807)


  - > Hammers are for hammering as money is for spending and acquiring, and when the adults watched the money being misused, their brains revolted in kind. (location: 833)
    How would other cultures respond to this?

  - > The symbol of money is very powerful—it can make us independent and selfish and insensitive to physical pain—but it’s also quite fragile: as soon as you tweak currency, even subtly so people don’t notice the difference, it starts to lose its symbolic association with value. (location: 1005)


  - > In chapter 1, Hurricane Katrina tugged just a bit harder at the heartstrings (and purse strings) of Kims, Kevins, and Kaylas because they associated the storm’s name with their own. In chapter 2, people were happier to travel to a store five miles south of town than to an identical store five miles north of town, having come to associate southerly journeys with the ease of moving downhill—a relic of gazing at hundreds of maps that depict north above south. And, in this chapter, the literal illumination of a lightbulb led students to metaphorically illuminate the hidden solution to a tricky mental problem. (location: 1011)


  - > When the image featured a collection of flowers, drinkers paid an average of only 15 pence per liter of milk consumed, whereas they paid 42 pence per liter when the image displayed a pair of eyes. (location: 1039)


  - > As her psychologists noted, children acquire most of their social and linguistic skills during a critical window early in their lives. Children who grow up without human contact tend not to acquire those skills, and just as people struggle to learn new languages after childhood, they rarely learn to engage in basic social interactions. (location: 1064)


  - > Even Siffre, who had volunteered to enter the cave, emerged disoriented, confused, and profoundly depressed, another victim of the ravages of social isolation. (location: 1086)


  - > Apart from the depression that sets in when people are forcibly isolated, one reason is that we tend to lose our sense of reality when we’re unable to confirm our version of the world with that of other (location: 1100)


  - > Opower has been incredibly successful, reducing power consumption in catchment areas by an average of 2.5 percent per person—a long-term saving of almost a billion kilowatt-hours across the United States since the company’s inception. (location: 1135)


  - > A soap opera in Brazil taught women to seek contraception, and fertility rates in areas that received the satellite signal fell dramatically, while they remained stable in nearby areas that were beyond the signal’s reach. (location: 1152)


  - > Not only do people naturally mimic one another, but those actions go on to create social bonds between strangers that form the foundation of future friendships. (location: 1192)


  - > Audiences accentuate our instinctive responses and make it more difficult to override those responses in favor of more carefully considered alternatives. (location: 1231)


  - > It’s easy to focus your energy on the opponent across the tennis net or the team on the opposite end of the field, but it’s much more difficult to focus on the entire population of competitors in the tournament or league all at once. (location: 1270)


  - > students certainly took the seizure seriously—many of them yelled, “My God, he’s having a fit!” as soon as it began—but they were far less likely to help when the presence of other potential helpers diffused their sense of responsibility first. (location: 1338)


  - > The inspiration for this research comes from a simple but staggering statistic: men are more than three and a half times more likely to die from all accidental causes than are women. (location: 1414)


  - > Although the skateboarders completed more difficult tricks successfully in front of the attractive female experimenter, her presence nudged them to fail many more and abort far fewer tricks. (location: 1426)


  - > For each five-hour shift, women who were not taking the pill earned an average of $335 during the fertile estrus phase, $260 during the infertile luteal phase, and only $185 when they were menstruating. (location: 1448)


  - > This result is disturbing, because it suggests that people harbor strong mental links between black males and crime—but it doesn’t directly answer the question of whether this association actually disadvantages black males in the real world. (location: 1494)


  - > The briefest flash of an image of apes was enough to shift people’s attention toward black faces—clear evidence that they associate the two concepts—and, more distressing still, to weaken their reactions to the police beating of a black victim. (location: 1512)


  - > Instead of promoting indiscriminate affection, oxytocin engendered warmth toward in-group members but not toward out-group members. (location: 1601)


  - > In fact, the photos dulled the pain slightly more effectively than did actually holding their partner’s hand, which suggests that imagined social support sometimes dulls painful experiences just as effectively as does real, live social support. (location: 1611)


  - >  (location: 1649)
    What about the fact that children werent always thought to be innocent?

  - > If you’re like almost everyone whom Müller-Lyer tested, Line B will appear longer than Line A. In fact, the two lines are identical in length, as this doctored version of the illusion shows: (location: 1697)


  - > That assumption wasn’t really tested before the 1960s, because until then almost everyone who had seen the illusion was WEIRD—an acronym that cultural psychologists have coined for people from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic societies. (location: 1701)


  - > How was it that African Bushmen and tribespeople were immune to the illusion, when they shared the same visual and neural anatomy as the Westerners who couldn’t shake the sense that Line B was longer than Line A? In the absence of biological differences, the answer was, of course, cultural. In contrast to most Western societies, the Bushmen, Suku, and Bete lived in worlds with very few straight lines. Their houses, often made of thatch, were either rounded or devoid of the hard lines that dominate Western interiors, and they spent most of their time gazing at natural scenes of grassland, trees, and water that similarly lacked geometric angles. (location: 1709)


  - > Ancient Greek philosophers, who formed the basis for much modern Western philosophy, tended to analyze objects in isolation from their contexts, whereas ancient Chinese philosophers were far more concerned with the relationship between an object and its context. (location: 1726)


  - > The American students devoted most of their attention to the focal object, and spent considerably less time focusing on its background. While the Americans gazed at the objects through Aristotelian eyes, the Chinese students viewed the scenes through a Confucian lens, focusing as much on the background as on the object. (location: 1736)
    Wild way to show cultural differences experimentally. This bears further consideration.

  - > Researchers still argue about the ultimate origins of individualism and collectivism, but one fascinating (and contentious) recent theory suggests that these tendencies might reflect the concentration of disease-causing microbes. Collectivistic societies are likely to thrive in pathogen-rich areas of the world, because collectivists tend to fear outsiders more than individualists, and they’re less likely to take the sorts of risks that might encourage disease. (location: 1788)


  - > Over time, then, collectivistic cultures thrived in pathogen-rich areas of the world, while their individualistic counterparts fell to the ravages of disease. Meanwhile, individualistic cultures thrived in areas with fewer dangerous pathogens. They tended to be more industrious, adventurous, and creative, so they dominated their collectivistic counterparts as long as they weren’t threatened by communicable diseases. (location: 1793)


  - > In a survey of almost five hundred famous Western and East Asian portraits, researchers found that the subject’s face covered an average of 15 percent of the canvas in Western artworks, and only 4 percent in East Asian artworks. In a similar analysis of Facebook profile pictures, 12 percent of a sample of Texan and Californian users displayed photos of their faces without any background, while fewer than 1 percent of a sample from Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taipei chose similar close-ups that focused on their faces and excluded the background. (location: 1841)


  - >  (location: 1885)
    Not quite true. Rural areas I’ve been in, in both Michigan and Indiana, have the same code.

  - > Although the concept of honor seems like a relic from a more traditional era, men who grow up in the culture of honor continue to respond differently from men who mature in other parts of the country. (location: 1905)


  - > When two nearby observers examined the men’s responses, they found that 85 percent of the students who grew up in the south were more angry than amused, whereas 65 percent of the students who grew up in the north were more amused than angry. (location: 1912)


  - > Psychologists noted that two West African cultural beliefs may have contributed to the so-called penis-napping epidemic. The first was the tendency to attribute unexplained events to malevolent witchcraft. The (location: 1946)


  - > The second belief was that witches and other supernatural beings would steal and eat a man’s penis or a woman’s womb, sometimes holding it hostage until a financial bribe was offered. (location: 1948)


  - > The hag, a malevolent mythical woman, occupies an important place in Newfoundland folklore, so locals sometimes conjure her image during episodes of sleep paralysis. People experience sleep paralysis elsewhere in the world, but they explain and understand the sensation very differently. In all, twenty-five such culture-bound syndromes appear in the official diagnostic and statistical manual of the American Psychiatric Association (the DSM), and the list is likely to grow when the association releases its next edition of the manual in 2013. (location: 1959)


  - > As a result, bicultural people like Andrew Lam are forced to engage in what psychologists call frame switching. According to the theory of frame switching, you can perceive the world either through the frame of one culture or through the frame of the other. (location: 1991)


  - > Westerners are more likely to criticize the person, assuming he generally cares little for the safety of others; in contrast, East Asians (Chinese included) are more likely to believe that the driver has been forced to drive fast because he’s in the midst of an emergency. (location: 1999)


  - > Westernized students in Hong Kong, who were familiar with both Chinese and Western culture, were shown either images of an American flag, Abraham Lincoln, and Superman (Western primes) or images of a stone monkey, the Great Wall of China, and a Chinese opera singer (Chinese primes). (location: 2004)


  - > Though researchers continue to question whether the lights were beneficial because they were blue, or rather because they attracted attention, several rigorous studies have shown that the color blue has remarkable effects on the human body. (location: 2090)


  - > People in the United States like black, possibly because they associate it with strength and masculinity, while it’s less popular in Colombia, where it implies sadness and formality. Color associations are especially powerful in the realm of foods, where red implies the richness of cherries, apples, and red meat, and purple implies that something’s amiss (unless you’re eating acai berries, one of the few natural foods that take on a purplish hue). (location: 2207)


  - > For some intellectual tasks, the tendency for red to prime avoidant mind-sets promotes just the right kind of thinking. Avoidance is also associated with vigilance, so tasks that require attention to detail are easier when we’re in a more vigilant mind-set. In one study, for example, students were far more vigilant when proofreading text for errors and memorizing a list of words when those tasks were presented against a red background rather than a blue background. Here vigilance and avoidance were precisely the mental states that promoted success. (location: 2305)


  - > In the world of competitive sports, where superstitious athletes refuse to wash lucky underwear, it’s hard to ignore the coincidence—and two anthropologists set out to show that the relationship between victory and the color red comes down to more than a random fluke. (location: 2319)


  - > These results show not only how insidiously the world around us shapes how we think, feel, and behave, but also how difficult it can be to construct a fair and just world free from bias. Red uniforms create an unfair advantage, black uniforms provoke undue aggression, and blue and white uniforms inspire comparatively meek behavior. (location: 2361)


  - > Moreover, children aren’t born innately prejudiced against black people; until the age of four or five years, perhaps once they’ve formed associations between whiteness and virtue and blackness and vice, they tend not to show evidence of anti-black prejudice at all. (location: 2391)


  - > Colors shape how we think and behave across a diverse array of contexts, and sometimes the same color has different effects depending on the context. Red fosters romance as it signals the flush of attraction, but it also prompts alertness and vigilance in the face of taxing mental tasks. Blue deters would-be criminals from misbehaving, but it also alleviates the symptoms of exhaustion and seasonal depression. (location: 2395)


  - > We’re driven to preserve a measure of personal space, which is why people respond strongly to brief unintended physical contact. (location: 2444)


  - > The researchers reasoned that children with poorer hearing are also less likely to engage in conversation and more likely to experience intellectual difficulties. And that’s what they found: the children who had lived on the lower floors for many years also struggled to read relative to other children of their age. Most distressing, when the children had lived in the buildings for more than six years, the researchers could predict their reading scores with astonishing accuracy by asking just one question: “On which floor do you live?” Since the effect of the noise grew over time, the researchers were able to rule out the possibility that residents on the higher floors were generally smarter, wealthier, or more dedicated to educating their children. Exposing children to cluttered noise for an extended period of time—even the background noise that comes with urban living—is enough to hamper their intellectual development. (location: 2459)


  - > According to ART, urban environments are draining because they force us to direct our attention to specific tasks (e.g., avoiding the onslaught of traffic) and grab our attention dynamically, compelling us to “look here!” before telling us instead to “look over there!” These demands are draining—and they’re also absent in natural environments. (location: 2510)


  - > As expected, people answered the three questions correctly more often when they were difficult to read. On average, they correctly answered 2.45 of the three questions correctly, whereas the students who read the questionnaire printed in a clear font averaged only 1.90 correct answers to the three questions. Later, we showed the same effect with complex logic problems, again showing that people answered them correctly more often when they were printed in a disfluent font. (location: 2612)


  - > This link between disfluency and riskiness probably explains why cognitive psychologist Danny Oppenheimer and I found that people began submitting increasingly revealing confessions on the website Grouphug.us in August 2008. (location: 2618)


  - > People generally found the violations quite offensive, rating them around 9 out of 10 on the moral wrongness scale—but these ratings dropped to 7.5 when the violations were printed fluently after earlier violations had been printed disfluently. When the later violations were surprisingly easy to read, the raters interpreted that experience to imply that the violations were less morally offensive. (location: 2642)


  - > Somehow, the students in the dimly lit room were liberated from the moral constraints of behaving honestly, a result that the authors attributed to the illusion that the darkness preserved their anonymity. (location: 2667)


  - > Since 1982, when Wilson and Kelling proposed their theory, the second littering example has received plenty of experimental support. In one study, social psychologists placed flyers on 139 cars in a large hospital parking lot. They were curious about whether the cars’ drivers would throw the flyers in the trash, or whether they would instead litter by leaving them in the parking lot. Before some of the cars’ drivers emerged from the parking lot elevator, the researchers scattered discarded flyers, candy wrappers, and coffee cups throughout the parking lot. At other times, they removed every last cigarette butt and piece of trash from the parking lot floor, conveying the idea that littering was both unusual and inappropriate. Nearly half of all drivers littered when the parking lot was already covered in litter—what’s one more piece of trash atop a foundation of garbage?—but only one in ten drivers littered when the parking lot was spotless. (location: 2676)


  - > These studies tell us something profound and perhaps a bit disturbing about what makes us who we are: there isn’t a single version of “you.” When you’re surrounded by litter, you’re more likely to be a litterbug; when you’re walking past buildings with broken windows, you’re more likely to disrespect the property that surrounds you. These norms change from minute to minute, as quickly as a New Yorker walks from one part of the city to another. It’s comforting to believe that there’s an essential version of each of us, that good people are good, bad people are bad, and that those tendencies reside within us rather than in the sights, sounds, and symbols that populate the landscapes that surround us from moment to moment. But social psychology calls that belief into question. (location: 2709)


  - > Part of the reason why context reinstatement—returning to an emotionally charged location—plagues heroin users is that the location forces them to relive old, related memories. (location: 2728)


  - > It’s impossible to know whether Santana would have responded differently on a cooler afternoon, but social psychologists have shown that baseball pitchers tend to hit more batters, and to retaliate more often, as the temperature rises. (location: 2756)


  - > El Niño years are characterized by warmer, dryer weather and unsettled stormy conditions, whereas La Niña years tend to be cooler, wetter, and more meteorologically stable. The results showed that civil conflicts in tropical regions are twice as likely to erupt during warmer El Niño years as during cooler La Niña years, and El Niño weather systems appear to contribute to one-fifth of all tropical conflicts. (location: 2785)


  - > Some criminologists even believe that the southern states are particularly prone to violent crime because they endure hotter summers than other parts of the country. The same southern states actually experience lower nonviolent crime rates, including theft and motor vehicle robbery, which suggests that they aren’t simply more crime-ridden across the spectrum of offenses; rather, they experience more aggression-related crime specifically. (location: 2791)


  - > men experience seasonal testosterone peaks in the winter months, and similar troughs in the summer months, producing about 30 percent more testosterone in the wintertime. (location: 2820)


  - > The students confused the physical sensation of cradling a warm cup of coffee for the metaphorical sense that Person A was warm and friendly. (location: 2861)


  - > Some researchers believe that physical coldness activates the insula, which leads people to feel lonely and socially isolated, and to seek social comfort in an attempt to overcome this sense of loneliness. (location: 2869)


  - > During the three disturbed foehn phases, people were slower to react to visual cues at a traffic exhibition in Munich, accident rates at a heavy machinery plant were especially high, and workers at a second industrial plant were more likely to report to the plant’s doctor’s office for medical attention. (location: 2930)


  - > When the researchers analyzed the results, they found that the positive ions made the participants more tense and tired, and less sociable and happy. According to the researchers, this constellation of damaging responses explained why winds and weather changes are associated with suicide, depression, irritability, crime, and industrial and automobile accidents. (location: 2943)


  - > The shoppers recalled three times as many items on the rainy days as on the sunny days, and they were approximately four times as accurate when identifying the ten objects from the longer list of twenty items. (location: 2958)


  - > The researchers explained that gloomy weather hampers our mood, which in turn makes us think more deeply and clearly. Humans are biologically predisposed to avoid sadness, and they respond to sad moods by seeking opportunities for mood repair and vigilantly protecting themselves against whatever might be making them sad. In contrast, happiness sends a signal that everything is fine, the environment doesn’t pose an imminent threat, and there’s no need to think deeply and carefully. (location: 2959)


  - > More recently, researchers have shown that altering people’s body clocks twice a year has its own significant costs, especially when they lose an hour of sleep in the spring. The day after daylight saving time begins, thousands of drivers labor under a regional case of jet lag, and accident rates rise by 7 percent on that day. Even more damaging, one anti–daylight saving researcher has claimed that students in daylight saving regions spend seven months of the year out of phase with their natural biorhythms. (location: 2984)


  - > At its heart, this book is designed to show that your mind is the collective end point of a billion tiny butterfly effects. Your thoughts, feelings, and actions are the products of chaotic chain reactions, fueled in no small part by the nine forces described in this book. (location: 3011)

  - > In a feminist critique of such efforts, Shari M. Huhndorf described “an inherently limited, contradictory mode of anticolonial resistance” that “implicitly grant[s] authority and legitimacy to [patriarchal] colonial nation-states.”19 Mohawk scholar Taiaiake Alfred elaborated, “It isn’t enough just to regain political space; we need to fill it up with indigenous content if it is going to mean anything to our people.”20 (location: 449)

  - > A similar conviction that Native agency is bolstered by alliances (between persons, things, times, and places) rather than divisions (between races, nations, cultures, and periods) is common to the artistic projects discussed in this book. (location: 463)

  - > “survivance” (Anishinaabe writer Gerald Vizenor’s enigmatic term combining survival and resistance) remains limited so long as they are aimed exclusively at the present and future.25 Divisive concepts of territory and identity may be challenged, but historical teleology is quietly affirmed. (location: 470)


  - > Tending toward objectivity and objectification, the archive appears to present a formidable challenge to the agency of any single human storyteller. (location: 497)


  - > Instead, Durham and select peers set out to transform struggles over the definition and ownership of space through artistic practice. From the beginning their efforts to recenter a vast story of modernity on displaced indigenous subjects and knowledge exceeded the “frameworks of identity” that persist in framing our view of much 1980s art today. (location: 580)

    Identity art - reminds me of allisoms critique of reclauming

  - > Still, it is not incidental that Durham’s art, along with much creative work of the AIM generation, ceded to the misapprehension of a solipsistic politics of identity. Media images of AIM foreshadowed this slippage, which was repeated in the discourse surrounding the trickster, a sacred miscreant and social critic drawn from indigenous cultural precedents who made regular appearances in AIM-generation art, literature, and criticism. The trickster of the 1980s and 1990s promised to unite elements of Native American philosophy and postmodern theory to emancipatory ends. Yet she inadvertently consigned colonized peoples to displacement without end, a disempowering scenario that was ultimately packaged and celebrated as another romantic identity. (location: 706)

    Gun allens critique of many native authkrs

  - > His apartment was a meeting space for African liberationists and “Indians in exile”; instead of a “Cherokee trying to be European,” he became, in his words, “a Third World internationalist.”24 Prompted by AIM events in 1973, Durham returned to the United States. From 1974 to 1979 he ran the movement’s New York office as a fundraiser and founding director of the IITC, seeking international allies to support treaty rights granting Native communities autonomy from the U.S. government. (location: 805)


  - > AIM was split among factions struggling to protect or recover their traditional lands, alleviate poverty on unproductive reservations assigned to their ancestors, or address the alienation of displaced “urban Indians” who had no hope of reclaiming lost territory. As we shall see, these differences compromised the movement’s collective ambitions. (location: 830)


  - > In 1969, a mixed group of Native Americans, many of whom arrived in the Bay Area as a result of federal relocation policies in the 1950s, launched an occupation of Alcatraz that lasted for a year and a half. The self-named “Indians of All Tribes” compared the sparse island, which featured the barracks of a former U.S. prison, to the dire conditions on Indian reservations, while playing host to movie stars, rock musicians, and journalists. In 1972, activists organized the “Trail of Broken Treaties,” pointedly referencing the Trail of Tears on their march to Washington, DC, to demand the replacement of the paternalistic BIA with a new era of policies respecting Native peoples’ right to self-determination. When the Nixon administration refused to meet with the protestors, the event escalated into an impromptu seizure of the BIA headquarters and a weekend of ransacking, destroying historical archives and Native American art while contributing to media stereotypes of savage, militant Natives.30 Today AIM is best remembered for activists’ armed takeover of the town of Wounded Knee on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota in 1973, site of the infamous massacre of Sioux men, women, and children by U.S. cavalry in 1890. Images of “Indians with bandannas and rifles” aired on national television almost nightly during the two-month siege. Instead of activists’ hoped-for federal renegotiation of a violated 1868 Sioux Treaty, 1974 brought the trials of leaders Russell Means, Dennis Banks, and others. After, the national media fell largely silent, although the IITC and other branches of the movement remained active throughout the 1970s and into the present.31 (location: 837)
    Whats the diff between aim and iitc?

  - > For Deloria, an essential conflict “between thinking in temporal and spatial terms” provides the philosophical underpinnings of decolonization. (location: 865)
    How is this reflected in art?

  - > The goal of the IITC throughout the 1970s was, in his words, to “get the United Nations, and countries of the world, on our side on issues of treaty rights and sovereignty so that we can begin to negotiate with the US on a more equal basis. We want the United Nations to take official action against US colonization and treaty-breaking.”41 (location: 896)


  - > Like Smith, Warrior, and others, he described a fundamental split between “traditionalists,” who remained spiritually connected to their land and cultures, and the young, urban militants, who were driven off the reservations by the twin effects of poverty and federal assimilation measures, “in many ways alienated from their roots.” (location: 936)


  - > In an essay first published in American Indian Quarterly in 1974, he argued that militant male leaders adopted colonial stereotypes in order to claim the authority to speak for all Native Americans: “The poses of tribal radicals seem to mimic the romantic pictorial images in old photographs taken by Edward Curtis for a white audience. The radicals never seem to smile, an incautious throwback to the stoical tribal visage of slower camera shutters and film speeds. The new radicals frown, even grimace at cameras, and claim the atrocities endured by all tribal cultures in first person pronouns.”50 (location: 949)


  - > Importantly, their insights recall the marginalization of indigenous women from the largely male, often misogynist leadership of AIM. Feminist critiques by Huhndorf, Devon Abbott Mihesuah, Andrea Smith, and others have exposed how Red Power nationalisms replicated divisive structures of gendered oppression—a key arm of colonization—from Western nation-states.53 (location: 965)


  - > Durham’s turn to art making similarly reflected awareness that “to the extent that we do not have a clear political understanding of our own situation and of the enemy’s methods, we co-operate in our own oppression.”60 (location: 1009)


  - > Through their failure to coalesce, the materials circumvent the ethnographic promise of fixing Indian identity to cast into relief Western practices of collecting, ordering, and displaying colonized peoples. These elements of On Loan from the Museum of the American Indian allied Durham with artists such as Fred Wilson, Adrian Piper, James Luna, and others in the 1980s who “offered a critical articulation of the history and persistence of race as a form of visual hegemony … building room-sized installations and public art projects structured around the twin logics of the artifact and the archive.”62 (location: 1028)


  - > Prioritizing spatial politics over issues of racial identity and equality distinguished the philosophical dimensions of AIM from African American and other civil rights movements and persisted as a component of subsequent artistic practices. (location: 1048)


  - > By framing Native objects as exotic signifiers of difference, marketplaces and museums wield the power to fix subjects and assert truths about them. Artifact Piece, she argued, reversed this white-dominated process. When Luna climbed onto a bed of sand and surrounded himself with everyday stuff, he seized an opportunity “to deterritorialize objects from mainstream popular culture, in order to reterritorialize them … forming a circuit of relays, a circulation of signs that are parallel to, but distinct from, that mainstream.”70 González’s account reflects optimism that artists can intervene in colonial institutions to create new configurations of subjects and objects, thereby recovering alternative histories and meanings. (location: 1102)


  - > Both works speak volumes about the field of white, effectively exposing the mechanisms of colonial displacement and fetishization, but stop short of positing an alternative Indian “real.” (location: 1111)


  - > They inadvertently affirm the power of white institutions to categorize Native cultures as romantic relics, by suggesting that live subjects can escape the deadening effects of ethnographic display only by resorting to postmodern parody. This attitude was widespread in the 1980s, echoed in Heap of Birds’s mantra, “No beads—no trinkets.”71 Too readily accepting the colonial severing of present from past and subjects from objects proved to be detrimental to spatial thinking. (location: 1116)


  - > The resulting bricolages bridge the modern bifurcation of ethnography and art history by wedding materials coded as “primitive” to cast-off industrial objects revalued in an avant-garde tradition of the readymade stretching from Marcel Duchamp to Robert Rauschenberg. Nailed, glued, and garishly painted with their seams still showing, works such as Tluhn Datsi (Cherokee for “panther,” 1984) resist consumption as emblems of purified nature or “primitive” peoples more readily than the organic totems of Manhattan Festival of the Dead (fig. 1.7). (location: 1138)


  - > In an important essay from 1992, “The Necessity of Jimmie Durham’s Jokes,” Richard Shiff argued that humor was an essential strategy for navigating, even rehabilitating, colonial displacement. (location: 1180)


  - > “Durham’s comic and ironic elements open up discursive routes of escape from the clichés of character and value that his Euro-American culture—he does not deny that it must in some sense be his—imposes upon [him]. The jokes insure that his art avoids all claims to self-mastery as well as any possibility that this particular ‘Indian’ identity will ever be mastered by the colonizers.”79 With nowhere to go but straight into a trap, Durham’s only “escape” lies in parody and puns. No matter how authoritative representations of Indians purport to be, they “always retain a reserve of meaning. Art that jokes exploits that reserve and becomes the natural enemy of categorization, enclosure, and fixity.” (location: 1184)


  - > among postcolonial theorists, namely how subaltern subjects might “speak” in resistance to colonial authorities dominating frameworks of reception.82 (location: 1197)


  - > The marginal, subversive other in a colonial formation, she assumes the perpetual burden of undermining, eluding, and critiquing colonial authority. This is a displacement without end. (location: 1222)
    Did female artists take a differenf route?

  - > Elsewhere Salish artist and activist Jaune Quick-to-See Smith introduced her own twelve-venue, multiyear endeavor, The Submuloc Show / Columbus Wohs, as a “response to the celebration of the holocaust of the Americas.”97 Durham’s contribution to the latter related that “Submuloc, and those who followed him into the 20th century, backed onto the shores of this hemisphere blindly, facing Europe.… He came from a primitive society given to torture and greed” and “shot to kill.” Hence the artists in The Submuloc Show / Columbus Wohs were “still trying to turn things around.” (location: 1285)

  - > Planned exhibitions of the artist’s work at the American Indian Contemporary Arts gallery in San Francisco and the Center for Contemporary Arts in Santa Fe in 1991 were canceled when he refused to provide paperwork proving his Cherokee bloodline in light of the newly implemented IACA.102 The “truth in advertising” law requires indigenous artists to certify their tribal heritage in order to label their work “Native American,” ostensibly to protect the lucrative Indian art market centered in Santa Fe from the threat of foreign knockoffs. (location: 1316)


  - >  (location: 1321)
    Sounds like a flashpoint...

  - > Chippewa painter David Bradley and the New Mexico–based Native American Artists Association were instrumental in promoting the legislation and lobbying for the cancellation of exhibitions in violation of the law. They launched a public hunt for “Wannabees, a tribe of the master race” (i.e., whites posing as Native American). Durham, who is not federally registered with the Cherokee Nation and had garnered unprecedented attention from non-Native scholars, critics, and institutions well beyond Santa Fe, was one of the group’s targets.104 The IACA reiterated colonial definitions of racial identity anchored in nineteenth-century federal Indian policy, supported by some Native individuals while challenged by others as anathema to indigenous systems of value.105 (location: 1322)


  - > bloodline to an ancestor who enlisted with the federal government following the passage of the devastating General Allotment Act. Whether in protest of the violation of treaties, the breakup of communally held lands and associated kinship networks, and the “humiliation” of being “catalogued,” or for reasons of economic destitution and displacement, many Cherokee could not or chose not to comply. While WalkingStick’s Cherokee grandfather worked as a clerk in an Oklahoma enrollment office in the late nineteenth century, Durham’s ancestors headed west prior to the Trail of Tears and did not settle on a federally designated reservation. He is among many self-identified Native people who cannot produce paperwork. (location: 1331)
    What it means to be natjvs is closely connected to art...

  - > “Authenticity is a racist concept which functions to keep us enclosed in ‘our world’ (in our place) for the comfort of a dominant society.” He stated, “I am Cherokee, but my work is simply contemporary art [and] not ‘Indian art’ in any sense.… I do not want a Cherokee license to make money selling ‘Indian’ art or any other art.”107 The law and related attacks were further affirmation of “just how badly [AIM] lost.”108 (location: 1338)


  - > Such claims echo efforts to redeem displacement as “a potent, even enriching motif,” despite Durham’s efforts to map transatlantic interdependencies between modernist exile, colonial displacement, and activist alliances.112 The repurposing of an exilic trope likewise overlooks Durham’s increasing engagement with forms of artistic itinerancy in the context of neoliberal globalization and art biennials, themes that I take up in greater detail in subsequent chapters. (location: 1353)


  - > “When I began researching the lives and myths of Pocahontas and Attakulakula in London I found such a morass of lies and of important truths untold, I realized that there was no way I could present a counter-narrative, even on the most elemental level.” (location: 1389)


  - > The most famous among them is a painting after an engraving by Dutch artist Simon van de Passe, reproduced in the pamphlet accompanying the exhibition with this caption: “ ‘An unbeeleeving creature, namely Pokahuntas,’ was taken to England by John Rolfe and baptized the Lady Rebecca. In 1616, an unknown artist painted this proper portrait of the transformed child of nature.”125 (location: 1415)


  - > air.” Certainly this miscellany is not evidence that holds up in a European court of law. It is a trial run by the vanquished of history, who find few reliable allies in archives and books. Durham builds his case through the accumulation of scraps and inventions. Every partial testament to violence, every material survivor, every creative act, every tiny triumph of a joke, is made to count. (location: 1468)
    Art as creating histlry

  - > I want all of our history. I need every name, every artefact, every effort. I need to know the minute specific of our history because I need to be part of it. But I am part of it, and could not choose otherwise, the way a Jew is part of the Holocaust. In the Cherokee language the word for the world and the word for history are the same.… We, you and I, must remember everything. We must specifically remember those things we never knew. Obviously that process cannot begin with longer lists of facts.… Perhaps we must trust confusion more, for a while, and be deeply suspicious of simple stories, simple acts.131 (location: 1476)
    Art as histpry story and complexity

  - > his contribution to Land, Spirit, Power in 1992: “Perhaps the best literal translation would be process. We do not traditionally see the earth as a mother but as a process that intimately includes us.… Within the concept of Eloheh is the idea that existence, the universe, is like a big council meeting. It is obviously one’s duty to be part of it, and that entails listening well and speaking well.”134 Echoing Durham’s earlier writings on indigenous spiritualism, Eloheh encompasses not only Cherokee ancestral lands in the southeastern United States, but also dynamic, ethical relationships between times, places, humans, and other-than-human persons that are not reducible to division, occupation, and marginalization. (location: 1490)


  - > Beyond authorial books and images, every scrap, every stone, “every name, every artefact, every effort,” is revalued as a legitimate bearer of history. (location: 1505)
    This is in some ways a reclaimjng of the material. A sanctificagjon ofnit. How vommon is it for artostis to use found objects?

  - > He went on to argue that Durham is involved in a struggle to “translate this complex Cherokee idea of carpentry into a contemporary art context,” resulting in ambivalence.141 (location: 1538)


  - > The project of carpentry aids in the reclamation of materials coded as negative in works such as On Loan from the Museum of the American Indian and Not Joseph Beuys’ Coyote by relating them to each other and to humans inside a house big enough to include them all. (location: 1558)


  - > For artists of the AIM generation, contemporary art nomadism is only the latest iteration of mobility that includes displacements engendered during some five hundred years of colonial occupation. Perhaps exhibiting in London reminded Durham of his failed experiment with modernist exile in Geneva on the eve of AIM two decades before. Rather than embracing estrangement, he engaged with history in an unprecedented manner, rejoining scraps and words to forge continuities between times, places, persons, and things. (location: 1566)


  - > In recent postcolonial and performance studies, scholars contrast two systems for organizing and transmitting knowledge: the archive of durable materials (e.g., texts, documents, artworks, buildings, and bones) and the repertoire of embodied practice (e.g., spoken language, religious rituals, dance, and sports). (location: 1604)
    How does native art agree and disagree wkth thks?

  - > In the former, Tac attempted to explain the cultural significance of communal songs and dances from which he was displaced. Instead of clarifying, his classifications pose the limits of text as a vessel for performance. In the latter, Tac openly acknowledged all that writing leaves behind, asserting that silence is preferable to words that mislead. Luna stated, “To write, and to be written about, holds high value in the Western world—you become validated … you exist. Can we talk?”10 His pointed selections from Tac’s manuscript at first glance support a binary of archive and repertoire, extensively theorized by performance studies scholars. In Taylor’s influential definition, “the archive” includes written documents, maps, charts, archaeological objects, bones, and other materials that appear resistant to change. It “sustains power” because it “works across distance, over time and space … [and] succeeds in separating the source of ‘knowledge’ from the knower.”11 Taylor contrasts hardened archival knowledge with the embodied enactment of memory (repertoire): oral culture, gestures, dance, and other activities performed by live subjects, commonly assumed to be ephemeral and nonreproducible.12 Although she stated that in practice they often work in tandem, Taylor demonstrated that the conceptual splitting and hierarchical valuation of archive over repertoire guided Europeans’ struggle to control indigenous peoples during the conquest in the Americas. (location: 1648)


  - > Rebecca Schneider asserted that the archive produces loss and at the same time generates a powerful desire for the lost thing or state—an “archive fever,” in the words of Jacques Derrida.16 (location: 1669)


  - > Criticizing this process only to reverse it, Taylor joined other performance studies scholars in championing embodied arts as a form of resistance to authority. (location: 1684)


  - > During the 1980s, Luna became known coast-to-coast for works that “abjure categorical purity” in an effort to rescue living Natives from the impasse of colonial simulations.29 Born of a Mexican American father and a Payómkawichum (Luiseño) / Ipi (Digeño) mother, the artist used his own body and related experiences as a malleable medium. (location: 1762)


  - > The only indigenous person in a department focused on minimalist sculpture, painting, and performance art, Luna experimented with abstract designs from southwestern Native basketry and took courses with Dutch artist Bas Jan Ader, feminist artist Eleanor Antin, and others then exploring the body as a flexible artistic form. (location: 1767)


  - >  (location: 1770)
    Histkty of western art

  - > Parallel to his art education, Luna witnessed AIM events unfolding around the country, including protests that involved what Paul Chaat Smith described as “a self-consciously theatrical sensibility, with a sophisticated understanding of what it would take to convince the international news media to pay attention to political grievances.”31 Luna attended conferences in southern California that hosted prominent Native activists and leaders, danced in powwows, and went to jail for protesting the display of indigenous mummies at the Southwest Museum.32 Engagements with pan-Indian politics and spiritualism inflected his growing artistic practice alongside his day job as a community college academic counselor. In 1977, Luna relocated to his ancestral lands on the La Jolla Indian Reservation, where he continues to live and work today. (location: 1770)


  - > Luna cast suspicion on “traditional” indigenous objects and practices appropriated by white anthropologists and New Age spiritual seekers. (location: 1787)


  - > Artifact Piece (1987), was “the beginning of a relationship between a museum and a living Indian who was there to make a statement; who wasn’t there to grind corn, or weave a blanket, or do something quaint for the Saturday crowd. I don’t even know how to fuckin’ weave a blanket.” (location: 1789)


  - > Art historian Jennifer A. González summarized the work thus: “Ritual objects for not-so-traditional rituals were … on display, taking the form of material and visual puns, while mocking the viewer’s desire for contact with ‘authentic’ Indian artifacts.”40 While the parodic mode may succeed in short-circuiting an ongoing process of colonial objectification, it does so by forcing a break between current lives and indigenous art forms and worldviews coded as the past. (location: 1833)


  - > By extension, colonial ontologies that sever past objects from present subjects persist. Crucially, this hard line is in danger of relinquishing the agency of ancestors along with their bones. (location: 1840)


  - > Fraser’s visual argument about Native Americans doomed to disappearance has long been the victim of the contemporary artist’s jokes—for example, when Luna straddled a sawhorse with a bottle of liquor in one hand for End of the Trail (1991). (location: 1887)


  - > Not surprisingly, scholars and critics concluded that Luna was up to his usual tricks in Venice, a “mestizo mind” putting “ambivalence” to strategic use in the fight against racism. (location: 1891)
    Figting against racism and for sovereignty are so diffdreng

  - > Recognizing the interdependence of human bodies and mutable materials throughout Emendatio finally entails approaching the performance and installations as a continuous field of interaction, rather than belonging to discrete artistic genres. (location: 1900)
    Challengkng artistic categories - dada. How did dada start?

  - > Art history has borrowed its cultural categories from the contours of the scientifically governed body as much as from formalist preoccupations, a line both crossed and managed through discourses of primitivism in the twentieth century. The pursuit of Native American and European arts as discrete fields of inquiry has never suited WalkingStick, whose complex and elective creative affiliations challenged the isolation of artists of Native heritage, beginning in the 1970s. At that time, prompted by pan-Indian cultural politics of the American Indian Movement and the death of her Cherokee father, WalkingStick began to explore the excised indigenous roots of her modernist training in archetypal forms. (location: 3011)


  - > While some of her AIM-generation peers responded with postmodern parody from the margins, I suggest that WalkingStick did not give up the possibility of belonging to both—or, more specifically, to their many historical intersections. (location: 3020)


  - > As Codex Vaticanus A suggests, modern classifications of race, culture, and kinship do not map neatly onto early colonial developments. Vanita Seth argued that Renaissance humans were as politically and culturally heterogeneous as they are today, but notably lacked a concept of a rational, sovereign European self required to posit a primitive other. (location: 3080)


  - > Seth furthermore emphasized that the Renaissance entanglement of bodies and origins was conceptually possible because time and space were not yet ironed into secular, historical notions of progress, which would become essential to denying indigenous peoples a coeval claim to modernity.24 (location: 3084)


  - > But as I have emphasized throughout this book, totalizing views of colonization as “covered ground” occlude the agency of Native contributors and prevent understanding of the complex affiliations that mark its historical—and art historical—record. Europeans were not the only ones to envelop that which was new and strange inside familiar, even familial frameworks; indeed, such practices were essential to the perpetuation of indigenous knowledge in the wake of conquest. (location: 3109)


  - > WalkingStick negotiated an energizing yet polarizing culture of critique in the wake of AIM. While I have already discussed key issues in relation to the practices of Jimmie Durham and James Luna, here I will cast that history in slightly different terms. As WalkingStick developed her painting practice in the 1970s and 1980s, difference had hardened into a seemingly incontrovertible framework dividing European and Native American art histories, following the contours of the racially governed body. (location: 3141)


  - > For Seth, nineteenth-century racial science dealt similitude a final blow, rendering the human body “a stable, transparent, and measurable object of knowledge—a body that is knowable precisely through its meticulously raced, sexed, and sexualized classification.”41 (location: 3146)


  - > As we saw in chapter 3, widespread critiques of industrial modernity as a force of alienation between the wars produced nostalgia for Native American art as an endangered connective tissue holding an otherwise divided world together. The image of a people still intimately bonded to nature fueled Marsden Hartley’s romance with the “red man,” who “knows every form of animal and vegetable life adhering to our earth, and has made for himself a series of … stirring dances to celebrate them, and his relation to them.”47 (location: 3171)


  - > Until that point, WalkingStick described her upbringing as devoutly Protestant and her education as “completely Male-Eurocentric.”53 An enrolled member of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, she grew up off-reservation with her mother and siblings in Syracuse, New York. (location: 3200)


  - > Emboldened by second-wave feminism and AIM activism airing on the news, the artist elected to dig into personal and political histories in her work. In Messages to Papa (1974), she made an eight-foot-tall tepee of wood and painted canvas, a pan-Indian symbol filled with feathers and letters addressing their fraught relationship from what she called “my white view, the white side of myself.”54 (location: 3204)


  - > The work soon caught the attention of Salish artist Jaune Quick-to-See Smith and others who invited her to join a growing network of Native artists across the United States and Canada, with whom she exhibited for years to come.56 (location: 3214)


  - > Curator William Rubin emphasized that European and American modernists valued “virtually any art alien to the Greco-Roman line of Western realism that had been reaffirmed and systematized in the Renaissance” (emphasis mine).61 (location: 3229)


  - > Echoing this theme, Abigail Solomon-Godeau responded to the traveling Paul Gauguin retrospective that opened at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, in 1988 by defining primitivism as “a white, Western and preponderantly male quest for an elusive object whose very condition of desirability resides in some form of distance and difference, whether temporal or geographical.”63 (location: 3236)


  - > Durham, Luna, and others initially addressed their displacement from the field of representation with mockery from the margins. Beginning with Fritz Scholder’s generation, the spare figural paintings of Fred Kabotie and the subsequent “Studio Style” that followed his lead were vilified for their perceived conservatism.65 Even Houle’s abstract canvases, which “infect” modernism with Native materials and histories, initially took the form of a postmodern rescue mission, as I will discuss in chapter 5.

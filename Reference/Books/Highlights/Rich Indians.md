  - > Americans’ reluctance to define extreme wealth as a moral problem made sense to him. “For many political and economic reasons,” Hacker wrote, “the 1990’s have surpassed the 1980’s in creating opportunities for becoming rich. And those who do, much like the rest of us, see no reason to refuse what comes their way.”1 (location: 72)

  - > “Since when are tax-cutting Republicans interested in redistributing wealth?” The proposed move in this case, they added, would perpetuate the broken promises and “outright theft” that stained the record of White people’s dealings with Indians.5 (location: 101)

  - > I had seen Indian names on an early twentieth-century list of rich ranchers in Washington State. Later I learned of Cherokees and Creeks whose immense landholdings in the 1890s earned them condemnation as immoral monopolists. (location: 120)

  - > Most fundamentally, anthropology affirms that wealth is a human invention and thus subject to continual reinvention. Although wealth is also a universal concept, its meanings are culturally and historically specific. (location: 299)


  - > How did they define wealth? How did they explain and legitimate their acquisition or accumulation of wealth? What purposes did their pursuit, possession, or control of wealth serve? What obligations did they feel to others as they engaged in economic activity? That is, what were their notions of economic justice? On what basis and by what processes did they allocate wealth? What power relations did these patterns reflect and effect? (location: 331)


  - > Wealth did not afford Indians the power to say which conceptions of Indians and which principles would determine the nature of their relations with Euro-Americans. (location: 358)


  - > 44 We can also see that some Indians came to approve of acquisitive individualism as a force for their people’s “advancement” even while other Indians embraced a contrasting economic ethos as essential to their cherished Indianness. (location: 367)
    Indian identity conceptions

  - > Before English settlers came, Beverley asserted, natives of Virginia had nothing they considered riches except “trifles” made of shell. “It was the English alone that taught them first to put a value on their Skins and Furs, and to make a Trade of them.” (location: 382)

  - > Native people of the Chesapeake region not only prized some substances that qualified as wealth in England, but, like the English, they sustained a political and social hierarchy with the acquisition, accumulation, and exchange of valuables. (location: 422)


  - > common British preconception of indigenous Americans as people without property became a self-fulfilling prophecy. (location: 430)


  - > According to Rountree, “‘wealth’ among the Powhatans consisted of food-stuffs and hides. (location: 453)


  - > not easily inheritable, and it was accessible to all, since the land was owned in common” and all able persons had procurement skills appropriate to their gender. (location: 454)


  - > “little or no economic specialization,” Rountree suggests, “everyone had a chance to prosper.” (location: 455)


  - > “ruling families” enjoyed “a truly noble lifestyle,” with privileges that included an abundance of high-status food and possessions. (location: 457)


  - > even “in late winter and early spring, when most people’s stores were gone.” (location: 461)


  - > The resulting accumulations had many possible functions. Besides satisfying the personal needs or vanity of noble families and their close associates, weroances’ treasuries provided the means to recruit or reward followers and allies, entertain visiting dignitaries, and relieve food scarcity by trading luxuries for corn from communities with staples to spare.11 (location: 466)


  - > “objects of sacred power.” They directed such objects to the weroance, who had power to “socialize” them for ceremonial use or redistribution. (location: 472)


  - > Although their kinship and economic systems differ, such “tribal” societies invariably idealize mutual caretaking and generosity, and they structure relations to enforce those ideals. That ethos does not preclude hierarchy. Even communities with modest material resources may acquire and stockpile things in excess of subsistence needs, and if the surplus funnels to a production leader, the conditions for a self-perpetuating unequal distribution of wealth arise. The leader has the wherewithal to be generous, but his beneficiaries reciprocate or induce his benevolence with offerings of their own, and he thus receives a disproportionate share of circulating wealth. (location: 484)

  - > rank and wealth were reciprocal constituents of a person’s social identity. (location: 510)

  - > In theory, riches were a means to fulfill the obligations of superior status rather than a means of attaining high rank. (location: 526)


  - > Rather than the “harmonious equilibrium” of the medieval ideal, says J. C. K. Cornwall, England was “a scenario of conflicting interests.” Although an enterprising man might pledge allegiance to the traditional social order and a moral economy driven by obligations to family and community, his conduct often suggested that hopes of private material gain determined his choices.22 (location: 541)


  - > Most were eager for material gain to a degree still suspect, though increasingly common, in their homeland.25 (location: 550)


  - > That example inspired many Englishmen to dream of earning personal and national glory by accomplishing similar feats, especially by discovering other New World lands replete with gold, silver, and gems.27 (location: 557)


  - > John Smith wrote with scorn of that ambition’s effect on his fellow colonists: “There was no talk, no hope, no work, but dig gold, wash gold, refine gold, load gold, such a bruit of gold.”30 (location: 568)


  - > “If the people be content to live naked and to content themselves with few things of mere necessity,” Hakluyt wrote in 1585, “then in vain seemeth our voyage, unless this nature may be altered. . . . If the people . . . be clothed, and desire to live in the abundance of all such things as Europe doth, and have at home all the same in plenty, yet we cannot have traffic with them, by means they want not anything that we can yield them.”33 (location: 583)


  - > In sum, the colonizers expected the thrust and results of their venture to hinge on whether Indians were rich or poor, zealous for material gain or indifferent to it. (location: 587)


  - > Many chronicles of subsequent exploration contrasted the opulence of the New World’s natural resources with the poverty or nakedness of its human occupants.35 (location: 595)

  - > Thomas Dale sent home in 1614, when the colony had yet to prove profitable, was patent boosterism. “I can assure you,” Dale trumpeted, “no Country of the world affords more assured hopes of infinite riches, which both by mine owne peoples discovery, and the relation of the Savages . . . assureth me.”39 (location: 621)

  - > William Strachey— a more clear-eyed or candid commentator than most— listed corn, copper, pearls, and beads as things the natives valued “according to their owne estymation.” (location: 629)


  - > Colonists were predisposed to classify as wealth the types of possessions found solely or largely among high-ranking persons and, conversely, to recognize such persons by the distinctive nature of their property. In England, after all, property was a signifier of rank as well as a necessary means to sustain one’s rank. (location: 636)


  - > his assumption that deerskins, pendants, chains, and mantles were savage marks of nobility as well as savage wealth. (location: 658)


  - > High-ranking persons displayed fewer and less ornate marks of distinction in Tsenacomoco than in England. Their houses were larger than others in native towns but not sumptuous, and their clothing was distinctive only on ceremonial occasions. Also, despite their apparent command of numerous servants, weroances performed the same subsistence tasks as “the common sort” did. (location: 670)


  - > And when profitable trade eluded the colony, company officers tried shifting the blame to the natives by belittling what they had to offer. (location: 688)

    Wealth is relative - why?

  - > Eventually, colonists reversed the ratio of Indian and colonial wealth for good by acquiring arable land, profiting from its use, and thus attracting many more of their countrymen. (location: 703)

  - > the colonists gained leverage until the balance of economic power tipped decisively in their favor. For native people as a whole, the consequences were ruinous. (location: 818)


  - > But within a few more decades, indigenous communities on the coastal plain lost enough of their land base to jeopardize their self-sufficiency, and before the end of the century, most were painfully poor by any measure of well-being. (location: 822)


  - > hapless English colony, at Indians’ expense, from an investor’s nightmare to an enterprising planter’s dreamscape. (location: 824)


  - > before the reconstituted Virginia Company resolved to create an agricultural province and reap profits from land sales— the colony’s success did not necessarily hinge on impoverishing indigenous people. (location: 833)


  - > no more talk in company councils of filling investors’ purses with money by filling Indian homes with English manufactures and clothing Indian bodies in English fabrics. The colonial enterprise then became a clear and present danger to the prosperity of nearby native communities. (location: 835)


  - > Implicit in this assertion of the English monarch’s sovereignty in Virginia was a notion that the indigenous inhabitants had no property rights English law would recognize. (location: 845)


  - > they maintained that the Indians lacked legal title to the country targeted for colonization.76 (location: 847)


  - > after a century of European intellectual debate about the rights of indigenous Americans, England was home to its share of thinkers who disagreed with the Crown’s position on Indians’ legal claim to land. (location: 852)


  - > “by what right or warrant we can enter in the land of these Savages, take away their rightfull inheritance from them, and plant ourselves in their places, being unwronged or unprovoked by them.”78 (location: 854)


  - > Legal scholar Stuart Banner, in the course of a broader argument that colonists in North America did acknowledge Indians’ landownership by paying them for some tracts, mentions just two early purchases in Virginia. In 1610, Virginia Company officials declared themselves justified in taking land for several reasons, but “‘chieflie because Paspehay, one of their Kings, sold unto us for copper, land to inherit and inhabite.’” (location: 865)


  - > however, assumes from the scattered and cryptic evidence that the English squatted in most places, then intimidated any native people who objected, sometimes appeasing them belatedly with gifts. In several instances, the English ran Indian occupants of at gunpoint. Either way, it is clear that colonists did not acquire many of their initial plantation sites by paying a price negotiated with willing native sellers.81 (location: 870)


  - > They devoted less effort to proving their own righteousness than to pointing out Indian transgressions, finding fault with the Indians’ character, and citing Powhatans’ ignorance or disobedience of God’s economic commandments to humanity. (location: 879)


  - > In their view, covetousness could explain why Powhatans craved European goods, stole from colonists, and allegedly buried valuables to hide them from each other.83 Wahunsonacock’s wealth, power, and privilege bespoke wicked greed as well. (location: 882)

  - > If the Indians were not developing the resources of their country as God intended, a more industrious, godly people could rightfully carry out the divine plan. (location: 897)


  - > Colonists would not be depriving Virginia’s natives of a “rightfull inheritance” if those natives had made no meaningful efforts to claim their legacy. (location: 902)


  - > The English, he said, intended to plant “a peaceable Colony in a waste country, where the people doe live but like Deere.” Just as Christians could lawfully make the wild deer’s habitat serve human needs, they could occupy and cultivate land that “wild” people wasted.87 (location: 904)

Seth Mallios argues that colonists provoked Powhatans to violence by breaking local rules of reciprocity, which he calls rules of a classic “gift economy.” To people whose model for economic relations was kinship obligations, English failures to meet those obligations would indeed have been grave offenses.

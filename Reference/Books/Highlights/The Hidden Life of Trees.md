  - > The saliva of leaf-eating insects can be “tasted” by the leaf being eaten. In response, the tree sends out a chemical signal that attracts predators that feed on that particular leaf-eating insect. Life in the slow lane is clearly not always dull. (location: 46)
    Damn that’s wild...

  - > But the most astonishing thing about trees is how social they are. The trees in a forest care for each other, sometimes even going so far as to nourish the stump of a felled tree for centuries after it was cut down by feeding it sugars and other nutrients, and so keeping it alive. (location: 47)


  - > Perhaps the saddest plants of all are those we have enslaved in our agricultural systems. They seem to have lost the ability to communicate, and, as Wohlleben says, are thus rendered deaf and dumb. “Perhaps farmers can learn from the forests and breed a little more wildness back into their grain and potatoes,” he advocates, “so that they’ll be more talkative in the future.” (location: 54)


  - >  (location: 66)
    Never thought about those struggles...

  - > WHEN I BEGAN my professional career as a forester, I knew about as much about the hidden life of trees as a butcher knows about the emotional life of animals. The modern forestry industry produces lumber. (location: 86)


  - > When you know that trees experience pain and have memories and that tree parents live together with their children, then you can no longer just chop them down and disrupt their lives with large machines. Machines have been banned from the forest for a couple of decades now, and if a few individual trees need to be harvested from time to time, the work is done with care by foresters using horses instead. (location: 99)


  - > Scientists in the Harz mountains in Germany have discovered that this really is a case of interdependence, and most individual trees of the same species growing in the same stand are connected to each other through their root systems. (location: 131)


  - > According to Massimo Maffei from the University of Turin, plants—and that includes trees—are perfectly capable of distinguishing their own roots from the roots of other species and even from the roots of related individuals.3 (location: 138)


  - >  (location: 144)
    Reminds me of the righteous mind...

  - > Every tree, therefore, is valuable to the community and worth keeping around for as long as possible. And that is why even sick individuals are supported and nourished until they recover. Next time, perhaps it will be the other way round, and the supporting tree might be the one in need of assistance. When thick silver-gray beeches behave like this, they remind me of a herd of elephants. Like the herd, they, too, look after their own, and they help their sick and weak back up onto their feet. They are even reluctant to abandon their dead. (location: 147)


  - > The trees don’t want to take anything away from each other, and so they develop sturdy branches only at the outer edges of their crowns, that is to say, only in the direction of “non-friends.” Such partners are often so tightly connected at the roots that sometimes they even die together. (location: 159)


  - > Because their roots are irreparably damaged when they are planted, they seem almost incapable of networking with one another. As a rule, trees in planted forests like these behave like loners and suffer from their isolation. Most of them never have the opportunity to grow old anyway. Depending on the species, these trees are considered ready to harvest when they are only about a hundred years old. (location: 164)


  - > Trees, it turns out, have a completely different way of communicating: they use scent. (location: 172)
    I want to enhance my sniffer so badly!

  - > Beeches, spruce, and oaks all register pain as soon as some creature starts nibbling on them. When a caterpillar takes a hearty bite out of a leaf, the tissue around the site of the damage changes. In addition, the leaf tissue sends out electrical signals, just as human tissue does when it is hurt. However, the signal is not transmitted in milliseconds, as human signals are; instead, the plant signal travels at the slow speed of a third of an inch per minute.4 Accordingly, it takes an hour or so before defensive compounds reach the leaves to spoil the pest’s meal. Trees live their lives in the really slow lane, even when they are in danger. (location: 186)


  - > The saliva of each species is different, and trees can match the saliva to the insect. Indeed, the match can be so precise that trees can release pheromones that summon specific beneficial predators. (location: 195)


  - > For if they can identify saliva, they must also have a sense of taste. (location: 200)


  - >  (location: 201)
    Can we smell these scents?

  - > Over centuries, a single fungus can cover many square miles and network an entire forest. (location: 222)


  - > And the fungi are pursuing their own agendas and appear to be very much in favor of conciliation and equitable distribution of information and resources.11 (location: 227)


  - > In the symbiotic community of the forest, not only trees but also shrubs and grasses—and possibly all plant species—exchange information this way. However, when we step into farm fields, the vegetation becomes very quiet. (location: 234)


  - >  (location: 238)
    This is wild....

  - > So trees communicate by means of olfactory, visual, and electrical signals. (The electrical signals travel via a form of nerve cell at the tips of the roots.) (location: 245)


  - > For the roots of seedlings not directly involved in the experiment reacted. Whenever the seedlings’ roots were exposed to a crackling at 220 hertz, they oriented their tips in that direction. (location: 252)


  - > GARDENERS OFTEN ASK me if their trees are growing too close together. Won’t they deprive each other of light and water? This concern comes from the forestry industry. In commercial forests, trees are supposed to grow thick trunks and be harvest-ready as quickly as possible. And to do that, they need a lot of space and large, symmetrical, rounded crowns. In regular five-year cycles, any supposed competition is cut down so that the remaining trees are free to grow. Because these trees will never grow old—they are destined for the sawmill when they are only about a hundred—the negative effects of this management practice are barely noticeable. (location: 260)


  - > And for trees belonging to different species that is indeed the case. They really do struggle with each other for local resources. But it’s different for trees of the same species. I’ve already mentioned that beeches are capable of friendship and go so far as to feed each other. It is obviously not in a forest’s best interest to lose its weaker members. If that were to happen, it would leave gaps that would disrupt the forest’s sensitive microclimate with its dim light and high humidity. (location: 266)


  - > And that’s what makes the research results so astounding. The rate of photosynthesis is the same for all the trees. (location: 276)


  - > Whoever has an abundance of sugar hands some over; whoever is running short gets help. Once again, fungi are involved. Their enormous networks act as gigantic redistribution mechanisms. It’s a bit like the way social security systems operate to ensure individual members of society don’t fall too far behind. (location: 279)


  - > In such a system, it is not possible for the trees to grow too close to each other. Quite the opposite. Huddling together is desirable and the trunks are often spaced no more than 3 feet apart. Because of this, the crowns remain small and cramped, and even many foresters believe this is not good for the trees. Therefore, the trees are spaced out through felling, meaning that supposedly excess trees are removed. However, colleagues from Lübeck in northern Germany have discovered that a beech forest is more productive when the trees are packed together. A clear annual increase in biomass, above all wood, is proof of the health of the forest throng.15 (location: 281)


  - > This is because a tree can be only as strong as the forest that surrounds it. (location: 291)


  - > Their well-being depends on their community, and when the supposedly feeble trees disappear, the others lose as well. When that happens, the forest is no longer a single closed unit. Hot sun and swirling winds can now penetrate to the forest floor and disrupt the moist, cool climate. Even strong trees get sick a lot over the course of their lives. When this happens, they depend on their weaker neighbors for support. If they are no longer there, then all it takes is what would once have been a harmless insect attack to seal the fate even of giants. (location: 294)


  - > Trees in a forest prefer to bloom at the same time so that the genes of many individual trees can be well mixed. (location: 315)


  - > How does the bird cherry distinguish between “mine” and “yours”? We don’t know exactly. What we do know is that the genes must be activated, and they must pass the tree’s test. You could say, the tree can “feel” them. You might say that we, too, experience the physical act of love as more than just the secretions of neurotransmitters that activate our bodies’ secrets, though what mating feels like for trees is something that will remain in the realm of speculation for a long time to come. (location: 356)


  - > In the years when the leaves shrivel and fall off, the trees look unusually bare, so it’s no surprise that reports on the condition of forests where the affected trees are growing describe the tree canopy as being in a pitiful state. Because all the trees are going through this process at the same time, to a casual observer the forest looks sick. The forest is not sick, but it is vulnerable. The trees use the last of their energy reserves to produce the mass of blossoms, and to compound the problem, they are left with fewer leaves, so they produce less sugar than they normally do. Furthermore, most of the sugar they do produce is converted into oil and starch in the seeds, so there is hardly any left over for the trees’ daily needs and winter stores—to say nothing of the energy reserves intended to defend against sickness. (location: 382)


  - > Scientists have determined that slow growth when the tree is young is a prerequisite if a tree is to live to a ripe old age. As people, we easily lose sight of what is truly old for a tree, because modern forestry targets a maximum age of 80 to 120 years before plantation trees are cut down and turned into cash. (location: 452)


  - > Dr. Suzanne Simard, who helped discover maternal instincts in trees, describes mother trees as dominant trees widely linked to other trees in the forest through their fungal–root connections. These trees pass their legacy on to the next generation and exert their influence in the upbringing of the youngsters.18 “My” small beech trees, which have by now been waiting for at least eighty years, are standing under mother trees that are about two hundred years old—the equivalent of forty-year-olds in human terms. The stunted trees can probably expect another two hundred years of twiddling their thumbs before it is finally their turn. The wait time is, however, made bearable. Their mothers are in contact with them through their root systems, and they pass along sugar and other nutrients. You might even say they are nursing their babies. (location: 459)


  - > Evenly formed trees absorb the shock of buffeting forces, using their shape to direct and divide these forces evenly throughout their structure. (location: 512)


  - > And because a tree grows only from its tip, the lower part remains crooked. The following winter, the tree is once more pressed out of alignment. Next year’s growth points vertically once again. If this game continues for a number of years, gradually you get a tree that is bent into the shape of a saber, or curved sword. It is only with increasing age that the trunk thickens and becomes solid enough that a normal amount of snow can no longer wreak havoc. The lower “saber” keeps its shape, while the upper part of the trunk, left undisturbed, is nice and straight like a normal tree. (location: 534)


  - > Where do they store what they have learned and how do they access this information? After all, they don’t have brains to function as databases and manage processes. (location: 601)


  - > Even more surprising for Gagliano was the fact that the mimosas could remember and apply their lesson weeks later, even without any further tests.21 (location: 609)


  - > it seems to me that these vibrations could indeed be much more than just vibrations—they could be cries of thirst. The trees might be screaming out a dire warning to their colleagues that water levels are running low. (location: 618)


  - > TREES ARE VERY social beings, and they help each other out. But that is not sufficient for successful survival in the forest ecosystem. (location: 622)


  - > Fungi are in between animals and plants. Their cell walls are made of chitin—a substance never found in plants—which makes them more like insects. (location: 631)


  - > That makes fungi the largest known living organisms in the world. The two aforementioned giants are not tree friendly; they kill them as they prowl the forest in search of edible tissue. (location: 635)


  - > They demand up to a third of the tree’s total food production in return for their services. (location: 649)


  - > Although many species of tree fight each other mercilessly above ground and even try to crowd out each other’s root systems, the fungi that populate them seem to be intent on compromise. Whether they actually want to support foreign host trees or only fellow fungi in need of help (which these fungi then pass on to their trees) is as yet unclear. (location: 669)


  - > Diversity provides security for ancient forests. Because fungi are also very dependent on stable conditions, they support other species underground and protect them from complete collapse to ensure that one species of tree doesn’t manage to dominate. (location: 675)


  - > At this time of year, water shoots up the trunk with such force that if you place a stethoscope against the tree, you can actually hear it. (location: 714)


  - > The trees pump themselves so full of water their trunks sometimes increase in diameter. The water is held almost completely immobile in the inner transportation tubes. Nothing flows. So where are the noises coming from? The researchers think they are coming from tiny bubbles of carbon dioxide in the narrow water-filled tubes.30 Bubbles in the pipes? That means the supposedly continuous column of water is interrupted thousands of times. And if that is the case, transpiration, cohesion, and capillary action contribute very little to water transport. (location: 724)


  - > Thus, old trees fertilize the forest and help their offspring get a better start in life. The youngsters don’t have their own moss because moss grows very slowly and takes decades to get established.32 (location: 787)


  - > That doesn’t matter to the oak, because its wood is permeated with substances that discourage fungi and severely slow down fungal decomposition. These tannins also scare off most insects and, incidentally and inadvertently, improve the taste of wine—should a barrel ever be made from the tree. (Think “oaked” wine.) Even severely damaged trees with major branches broken off can grow replacement crowns and live for a few hundred years longer. (location: 844)


  - > Possibly, but now we know that trees can learn. This means they must store experiences somewhere, and therefore, there must be some kind of a storage mechanism inside the organism. Just where it is, no one knows, but the roots are the part of the tree best suited to the task. The old spruce in Sweden also shows that what grows underground is the most permanent part of the tree—and where else would it store important information over a long period of time? (location: 960)


  - > When a root feels its way forward in the ground, it is aware of stimuli. The researchers measured electrical signals that led to changes in behavior after they were processed in a “transition zone.” If the root encounters toxic substances, impenetrable stones, or saturated soil, it analyzes the situation and transmits the necessary adjustments to the growing tip. The root tip changes direction as a result of this communication and steers the growing root around the critical areas. (location: 973)


  - > However, there are still a few old deciduous forests that act as refuges where the original diversity of species still exists. All over Germany, forestry commissions are trying to grow more deciduous than coniferous forests once again. But if mighty beeches are to herald change and stand once again where spruce now topple in storms, how will the beetle mites and springtails get back to these places? (location: 1039)


  - > We don’t know how long it will take until true forest soil is created once again, but we do know that a hundred years is not enough. (location: 1058)


  - > To make it possible for this regeneration to happen at all, you need preserves with ancient forests free from any human interference. (location: 1059)
    Where there is no certain kind of human interference - why doesn't he acknowledge indigenous peoples?

  - > The assertion that burning wood is climate neutral is based on this concept. After all, it makes no difference if it’s small organisms reducing pieces of wood to their gaseous components or if the home hearth takes on this task, right? But how a forest works is way more complicated than that. The forest is really a gigantic carbon dioxide vacuum that constantly filters out and stores this component of the air. (location: 1077)


  - > It’s true that some of this carbon dioxide does indeed return to the atmosphere after a tree’s death, but most of it remains locked in the ecosystem forever. (location: 1080)


  - > And so it is that carbon dioxide finds its final resting place in the form of humus, which continues to become more concentrated as it ages. In the far distant future, it might even become bituminous or anthracite coal. (location: 1083)


  - > As a result, warming rays of sunlight reach the ground and help the species living there kick into high gear. This means they consume humus layers even deep down into the soil, releasing the carbon they contain into the atmosphere as gas. The total quantity of climate-changing gases that escapes is roughly equivalent to the amount of timber that has been felled. For every log you burn in your fire at home, a similar amount of carbon dioxide is being released from the forest floor outside. And so carbon stores in the ground below trees in our latitudes are being depleted as fast as they are being formed.40 (location: 1092)


  - > The latest forest inventories document that trees are growing more quickly than they used to. The spreadsheets that estimate lumber production need to be adjusted now that one third more biomass is accruing than a few decades ago. But what was that again? If you are a tree, slow growth is the key to growing old. Growth fueled by hefty additions of excess nitrogen from agricultural operations is unhealthy. And so the tried and tested rule holds true: less (carbon dioxide) is more (life-span). (location: 1113)


  - > The researchers looked at about 700,000 trees on every continent around the world. The surprising result: the older the tree, the more quickly it grows. Trees with trunks 3 feet in diameter generated three times as much biomass as trees that were only half as wide.42 So, in the case of trees, being old doesn’t mean being weak, bowed, and fragile. Quite the opposite, it means being full of energy and highly productive. This means elders are markedly more productive than young whippersnappers, and when it comes to climate change, they are important allies for human beings. Since the publication of this study, the exhortation to rejuvenate forests to revitalize them should at the very least be flagged as misleading. (location: 1124)


  - > With their annual leaf fall, the beeches created an alkaline humus that could store a lot of water. In addition, the air in this little forest gradually became moister, because the leaves of the growing beeches calmed the air by reducing the speed of the wind blowing through the trunks of the pines. Calmer air meant less water evaporated. (location: 1140)


  - > As foresters like to say, the forest creates its own ideal habitat. (location: 1145)


  - > In the forest I manage, students from RWTH Aachen discovered just how great the temperature differences can be between a coniferous plantation that is regularly thinned and a beech forest that has been allowed to age naturally. On an extremely hot August day that chased the thermometer up to 98 degrees Fahrenheit, the floor of the deciduous forest was up to 50 degrees cooler than that of the coniferous forest, which was only a couple of miles away. This cooling effect, which meant less water lost, was very clearly because of the biomass, which also contributed shade. The more living and dead wood there is in the forest, the thicker the layer of humus on the ground and the more water is stored in the total forest mass. (location: 1147)


  - > When there are freezing temperatures, people who park their cars out in the open have to scrape ice from their windows, whereas cars parked under trees often remain ice free. (location: 1161)


  - > I find it fascinating how much spruce and other species influence microclimates in their vicinity. Consider how much greater the influence of an undisturbed forest must be. (location: 1162)


  - > During a severe storm, a mature tree can down an additional couple of hundred gallons of water that, thanks to its construction, it funnels to its roots. There, the water is stored in the surrounding soil, where it can help the tree over the next few dry spells. (location: 1170)


  - > When these molecules get into the air, moisture condenses on them, creating clouds that are twice as thick as the clouds over non-forested areas. The possibility of rain increases, and in addition, about 5 percent of the sunlight is reflected away from the ground. Temperatures in the area fall. Cool and moist—just how conifers like it. Given this reciprocal relationship between trees and weather, forest ecosystems probably play an important role in slowing down climate (location: 1209)


  - > Streams, ponds—even the forest itself—all these ecosystems depend on providing their inhabitants with as much stability as they can. A good example of an organism that doesn’t like a lot of change is the freshwater snail. Depending on the species, it is often less than 0.08 inches long, and it loves cold water. They like it to be no more than 46 degrees Fahrenheit, and for some freshwater snails the reason for this lies in their past: their ancestors lived in the meltwater that drained off the glaciers covering a large part of Europe in the last ice age. (location: 1214)


  - > The forest floor acts as a huge sponge that diligently collects all the rainfall. The trees make sure that the raindrops don’t land heavily on the ground but drip gently from their branches. (location: 1221)


  - > Like the freshwater snails, they need the water to remain cool so that oxygen doesn’t escape, but if the water freezes solid, the baby salamanders will die. It’s a good thing deciduous trees just happen to solve this problem. In winter, when there is very little warmth in the sun, bare branches allow a lot of warmth to penetrate. The movement of water over the uneven bottom also protects the stream from suddenly freezing. When the sun climbs higher in the sky in late spring and the air is noticeably warmer, the trees unfurl their leaves, closing the blinds and shading the running water. Then in the fall, when temperatures drop once again, the sky reopens above the stream when the trees drop all their leaves. It’s tougher for streams that flow under coniferous trees. It’s bitterly cold here in winter, and sometimes the water freezes solid. (location: 1236)


  - > For many animals, however, sap-sucking pests such as aphids are a blessing. (location: 1305)


  - > You can try this out for yourself in the spring. If you come across a spruce recently downed by the wind, cut off the bark with a pocketknife. Then run the blade flat along the exposed trunk and peel off long strips about a third of an inch wide. Cambium tastes like slightly resinous carrots, and it’s very nutritious. (location: 1343)


  - > Grass is a rarity in a natural forest and almost never present in the quantities a whole herd requires, and therefore, these majestic animals prefer to live out in the open. But river valleys, where floods ensure open grassland, are where people like to live. Every square yard is used for urban areas or agriculture. And so the deer have retreated to the forest, even though they sneak out at night. But as typical plant eaters, they need fiber-rich food around the clock. When there isn’t anything else, in desperation, they turn to tree bark. (location: 1392)


  - > I have often seen tree youngsters like this that have managed to close wounds, even though it took them decades. It’s quite another story with the planted trees in our commercial forests. Usually, they grow very quickly and their growth rings are huge; therefore, their wood contains a great deal of air. Air and moisture—these are ideal conditions for fungi. (location: 1402)
    Reminds me of domesticated vs wild animals

  - > And this explains why it is so important to keep old trees. If they are cleared away, these little black guys can’t just wander over to the next tree; they simply don’t have the energy to do that. (location: 1459)


  - > The more species there are around, the less chance there is that a single one will take over to the detriment of the others, because there’s always a candidate on hand to counteract the menace. And even the dead tree trunk can offer a valuable service managing water for living trees merely because it is there, as we’ve already seen in chapter 17, “Woody Climate Control.” (location: 1462)


  - > In total, a fifth of all animal and plant species—that’s about six thousand of the species we know about—depend on dead wood.50 (location: 1502)


  - > Above all, they need to break down their green coloring, chlorophyll, into its component parts so that the following spring they can send large quantities of it back out to the new leaves. As this pigment is pumped out of the leaves, the yellow and brown colors that were there all along predominate. These colors are made of carotene and probably serve as alarm signals. Around this time, aphids and other insects are seeking shelter in cracks in the bark, where they will be protected from low temperatures. (location: 1538)


  - > Sleep deprivation affects trees and people in much the same way: it is life threatening. That’s why oaks and beeches can’t survive if we try to grow them in containers in our living rooms. We don’t allow them to get any rest there, and so most of them die within the first year. (location: 1591)


  - > But if we take a closer look, the whole thing is a big mystery, because it means that trees need something very important: a sense of time. How do they know that winter is coming or that rising temperatures aren’t just a brief interlude but an announcement that spring has arrived? (location: 1633)


  - > ones depends not only on temperature but also on how long the days are. Beeches, for example, don’t start growing until it is light for at least thirteen hours a day. That in itself is astounding, because to do this, trees must have some kind of ability to see. (location: 1646)


  - > This means that if the oaks behave differently, it must be because of their own innate characteristics. And they do, indeed, behave differently! (location: 1680)


  - > Take a look at the trees growing around a small clearing. All have the same temptation to do something stupid like growing new branches on their trunks, but only a few give in. The rest keep their bark nice and smooth and avoid the predictable risk. (location: 1715)


  - > When trees are planted in these restricted spaces, conflicts are inevitable. In such places, plane trees, maples, and lindens like to feel out underground wastewater pipes. We notice the damage when the next storm comes and the streets fill with water. Then specialists armed with root probes investigate to see which tree has caused the blockage. (location: 1935)


  - > The study found the roots in the pipes were growing above the water table and did not seem interested in extra nutrients. What was attracting them was loose soil that had not been fully compacted after construction. Here, the roots found room to breathe and grow. It was only incidentally that they penetrated the seals between individual sections of pipe and eventually ran riot inside them. (location: 1941)


  - > Many of the companions that look after trees’ well-being in the forest (such as the microorganisms that make humus) are missing. Mycorrhizal fungi that help collect water and food are present only in low numbers. Urban trees, therefore, have to go it alone under the harshest conditions. (location: 1953)


  - > They love warm crowns drenched in sunlight. In the middle of the forest, these are hard to find. The few oaks that grow in the forest are mixed in with beeches, and only their topmost tips reach the light. In the city, however, oaks stand out in the open, where they are warmed by the sun all day long. The caterpillars love this. And as the whole “forest” in urban areas offers such perfect conditions, it’s no surprise that there are population explosions, which are a stern reminder that oaks and other species growing along the streets and between houses have to fight for their (location: 1972)


  - > Even if we were to have a Spanish-style climate here in Hümmel sometime in the future, an overwhelming number of the trees would cope. The only proviso is that the social structure of the forest is not disturbed by lumber operations so that the forest can continue to regulate its own microclimate for itself. (location: 2193)


  - > Loners standing unprotected out in the cold fog succumb markedly more often than well-connected individuals in a dense forest who can lean on their neighbors for support. Moreover, the wind tends to blow over dense forest canopies, so mostly it is just the highest branch tips that get heavily blanketed with ice crystals. (location: 2243)


  - > Migrating birds bring small animals, fungal spores, or the seeds of new species of trees tucked in their feathers, or these organisms are blown in by turbulent storms. A five-hundred-year-old tree has surely had a few surprises in its life. And thanks to the great genetic diversity in a single species of tree, there is always a sufficient number of individuals that can rise to a new challenge. (location: 2375)


  - > A decisive factor in how robust native forests are in the face of such changes is how unspoiled they are. The more intact the social connections and the more moderated the microclimate under the trees, the more difficult it is for foreign invaders to get established. (location: 2382)


  - > There is a scientific observation that speaks to this: the blood pressure of forest visitors rises when they are under conifers, whereas it calms down and falls in stands of oaks.66 Why don’t you take the test for yourself and see in what type of forest you feel most comfortable? (location: 2433)

  - >  (location: 35)
    How has this worked? What strategies do they use?

  - >  (location: 37)
    This is fascinating...

  - > This unconventional, often infuriating, but deeply productive way of working has led to a way of presenting the world and how to think about it, that I never could have created on my own. (location: 42)


  - > The Democrats and Republicans in the United States often claim that their opponents don’t know the facts. If they measured their own knowledge instead of pointing at each other, maybe everyone could become more humble. When we polled in the United States, only 5 percent picked the right answer. The other 95 percent, regardless of their voting preference, believed either that the extreme poverty rate had not changed over the last 20 years, or, worse, that it had actually doubled—which is literally the opposite of what has actually happened. (location: 150)


  - > In 2017 we asked nearly 12,000 people in 14 countries to answer our questions. They scored on average just two correct answers out of the first 12. No one got full marks, and just one person (in Sweden) got 11 out of 12. A stunning 15 percent scored zero. (location: 161)


  - > But most of them—a stunning majority of them—get most of the answers wrong. Some of these groups even score worse than the general public; some of the most appalling results came from a group of Nobel laureates and medical researchers. It is not a question of intelligence. Everyone seems to get the world devastatingly wrong. (location: 167)


  - > Not only devastatingly wrong, but systematically wrong. By which I mean that these test results are not random. They are worse than random: they are worse than the results I would get if the people answering my questions had no knowledge at all. (location: 170)


  - > Sure, the media plays a role, and I discuss that later, but we must not make them into a pantomime villain. We cannot just shout “boo, hiss” at the media. (location: 212)
    i love the writing style of this book

  - > At least that’s the picture that most Westerners see in the media and carry around in their heads. I call it the overdramatic worldview. It’s stressful and misleading. (location: 233)


  - > Step-by-step, year-by-year, the world is improving. Not on every single measure every single year, but as a rule. Though the world faces huge challenges, we have made tremendous progress. This is the fact-based worldview. (location: 237)


  - > So if your worldview is wrong, then you will systematically make wrong guesses. (location: 240)


  - > And I am convinced it is not the fault of an evil-minded media, propaganda, fake news, or wrong facts. (location: 242)


  - > Knowing that most people are deluded means you don’t need to be embarrassed. Instead you can be curious: how does the illusion work? (location: 253)
    This is the solution to my dilemma!

  - > Our brains often jump to swift conclusions without much thinking, which used to help us to avoid immediate dangers. We are interested in gossip and dramatic stories, which used to be the only source of news and useful information. (location: 259)


  - > We have to teach our children, and ourselves, to stay away from sweets and chips. In the same way, our quick-thinking (location: 263)
    what a fascinating take on this - we have to lear to regulate our information intake.

  - > Don’t misunderstand me. We still need these dramatic instincts to give meaning to our world and get us through the day. If we sifted every input and analyzed every decision rationally, a normal life would be impossible. We should not cut out all sugar and fat, and we should not ask a surgeon to remove the parts of our brain that deal with emotions. But we need to learn to control our drama intake. (location: 265)


  - > It is my last attempt to make an impact on the world: to change people’s ways of thinking, calm their irrational fears, and redirect their energies into constructive activities. (location: 270)


  - > This is data as you have never known it: it is data as therapy. It is understanding as a source of mental peace. Because the world is not as dramatic as it seems. (location: 274)
    Dovetails with my writing on boring

  - > Factfulness, like a healthy diet and regular exercise, can and should become part of your daily life. Start to practice it, and you will be able to replace your overdramatic worldview with a worldview based on facts. You will be able to get the world right without learning it by heart. You will make better decisions, stay alert to real dangers (location: 275)


  - > I will teach you how to recognize overdramatic stories and give you some thinking tools to control your dramatic instincts. (location: 278)


  - > Like a huge thermometer. Because children are very fragile. There are so many things that can kill them. (location: 313)
    Like a canary in a mine

  - > I’m talking about that irresistible temptation we have to divide all kinds of things into two distinct and often conflicting groups, with an imagined gap—a huge chasm of injustice—in between. It is about how the gap instinct creates a picture in people’s heads of a world split into two kinds of countries or two kinds of people: rich versus poor. (location: 334)


  - > I call them mega misconceptions because they have such an enormous impact on how people misperceive the world. (location: 339)


  - > “The people you see in exotic documentaries on TV. Those parents struggle harder than anyone to make their families survive, and still they lose almost half of their children. Fortunately, fewer and fewer people have to live under such dreadful conditions.” (location: 344)
    How much is colonialism a problem here? Is he critiqued for that?

  - > This picture clearly shows a world divided into two groups, with a gap in the middle. How nice. What a simple world to understand! So what’s the big deal? Why is it so wrong to label countries as “developed” and “developing”? Why did I give my student who referred to “us and them” such a hard time? Because this picture shows the world in 1965! (location: 402)


  - > Only tiny percentages—way less than the chimps’ 33 percent—got these answers right, and large majorities picked the worst alternative we offered, even when those numbers represented levels of misery now being suffered only during terrible catastrophes in the very worst places on Earth. (location: 455)
    The real question, according to the article I read, is ithis all sustainable...

  - > To summarize: low-income countries are much more developed than most people think. And vastly fewer people live in them. The idea of a divided world with a majority stuck in misery and deprivation is an illusion. A complete misconception. Simply wrong. (location: 466)
    What about variation within countries? And extrimistan from Black Swan?

  - > The majority of people live neither in low-income countries nor in high-income countries, but in middle-income countries. This category doesn’t exist in the divided mind-set, but in reality it definitely exists. It’s where 75 percent of humanity lives, (location: 478)
    This seems to be a real and important point.

  - > Afterward, people ask me, “So what should we call them instead?” But listen carefully. It’s the same misconception: we and them. What should “we” call “them” instead? What we should do is stop dividing countries into two groups. It doesn’t make sense anymore. It doesn’t help us to understand the world in a practical way. It doesn’t help businesses find opportunities, and it doesn’t help aid money to find the poorest people. (location: 486)


  - > them, I will now suggest an equally simple but more relevant and useful way of dividing up the world. (location: 493)


  - > Two of your children start high school. If they manage to finish, they will be able to get better-paying jobs than you have ever had. To celebrate, you take the whole family on its first-ever vacation, one afternoon to the beach, just for fun. (Roughly 2 billion people live like this today.) (location: 526)
    So this is where things get sticky because people can stay here or above.

  - > that it is possible to move through the levels, both for individuals and for countries; and above all the understanding that there are not just two kinds of lives. (location: 539)
    How often do countries move backwards?

  - > I think this is because human beings have a strong dramatic instinct toward binary thinking, a basic urge to divide things into two distinct groups, with nothing but an empty gap in between. We love to dichotomize. (location: 550)


  - > The gap instinct makes us imagine division where there is just a smooth range, difference where there is convergence, and conflict where there is agreement. (location: 557)
    He's describing the world as mediocristan.

  - > When we compare two averages, we risk misleading ourselves even more by focusing on the gap between those two single numbers, and missing the overlapping spreads, the overlapping ranges of numbers, that make up each average. That is, we see gaps that are not really there. (location: 568)


  - >  (location: 570)
    The reverse can also be true. I see how this book can be one sided.

  - > Of course, gap stories can reflect reality. In apartheid South Africa, black people and white people lived on different income levels and there was a true gap between them, with almost no overlap. The gap story of separate groups was absolutely relevant. (location: 586)


  - > In the United States, for example, people are classified as below the poverty line even if they live on Level 3. (location: 615)
    So really they should be grateful, right?? Sheesh

  - > extreme poverty on Level 1 know very well how much better life would be if they could move from $1 a day to $4 a day, not to mention $16 a day. People who have to walk everywhere on bare feet know how a bicycle would save them tons of time and effort and speed them to the market in town, and to better health and wealth. (location: 629)


  - > Misconceptions disappear only if there is some equally simple but more relevant way of thinking to replace them. That’s what the four levels do. (location: 636)


  - > To control the gap instinct, look for the majority. (location: 642)


  - > Which statement do you agree with most? □   A: The world is getting better. □   B: The world is getting worse. □   C: The world is getting neither better nor worse. (location: 653)
    Can't it be both? This seems somewhat reductive....

  - > This chapter is about the negativity instinct: our tendency to notice the bad more than the good. This instinct is behind the second mega misconception. (location: 671)
    This seems very similar to righteous mind. Why ara so many books like this coming out around now?

  - > The number of war fatalities has been falling since the Second World War, but with the Syrian war, the trend has reversed. Terrorism too is rising again. (We’ll get back to that in chapter 4.) (location: 674)
    Ok he seems a little bit more balanced.

  - > In order for this planet to have financial stability, peace, and protected natural resources, there’s one thing we can’t do without, and that’s international collaboration, based on a shared and fact-based understanding of the world. (location: 681)
    This is exactly what Trump and his supporters are against. It's how he can claim to not be racist as well.

  - > Today almost everybody has escaped hell. The original source of all human suffering is about to be eradicated. We should plan a party! A big party! And when I say “we,” I mean humanity! (location: 726)
    Fascinating - a quasi religious tone

  - > There’s a dip in the global life expectancy curve in 1960 because 15 to 40 million people—nobody knows the exact number—starved to death that year in China, in what was probably the world’s largest ever man-made famine. (location: 752)
    I had no idea it was that bad... My god.

  - > the catastrophe was kept secret by the Chinese government for 36 years. It wasn’t described in English to the outside world until 1996. (Think about it. Could any government keep the death of 15 million people a global secret today?) (location: 757)
    What the hell? This is absolutely insane...

  - > Let’s start with 16 terrible things that are on their way out, (location: 806)
    This is spotty predicion - not all of these are guaranteed - especially gas prices and oil spills

  - > The goal of longer lives is not just extra time. The ultimate goal is to have the freedom to do what we want. (location: 816)
    This is an interesting point, that compared to the past things are better. But I think he could do a better job of showing that the trends will continue - and which won't

  - > There are three things going on here: the misremembering of the past; selective reporting by journalists and activists; and the feeling that as long as things are bad it’s heartless to say they are getting better. (location: 822)


  - > When Lasse showed the villagers the 1970s pictures they couldn’t believe the photos were taken in their neighborhood. “No,” they said. “This can’t be here. You must be mistaken. We have never been that poor.” Like most people, they were living in the moment, busy with new problems, like the children watching immoral soap operas or not having enough money to buy a motorbike. (location: 834)


  - > Stories about gradual improvements rarely make the front page even when they occur on a dramatic scale and impact millions of people. (location: 845)
    Because of our bias, not necessarily any fault of journalists, who are human, too. but the profit model doesn't help

  - > When central planning resulted in mass famine in rural China, millions starved to death while the youngsters in Europe waving communist red flags knew nothing about it. (location: 848)
    I do agree with Black Swan's critique of communism which is the inability to predict.

  - > This illusion of deterioration creates great stress for some people and makes other people lose hope. For no good reason. (location: 860)


  - > There’s something else going on as well. What are people really thinking when they say the world is getting worse? My guess is they are not thinking. They are feeling. If you still feel uncomfortable agreeing that the world is getting better, even after I have shown you all this beautiful data, my guess is that it’s because you know that huge problems still remain. (location: 862)


  - > the world is getting better is like me telling you that everything is fine, or that you should look away from these problems and pretend they don’t exist: and that feels ridiculous, and stressful. (location: 865)
    This exactly my experience. Maybe this guy has more merit than I think.

  - > I agree. Everything is not fine. We should still be very concerned. As long as there are plane crashes, preventable child deaths, endangered species, climate change deniers, male chauvinists, crazy dictators, toxic waste, journalists in prison, and girls not getting an education because of their gender, as long as any such terrible things exist, we cannot relax. (location: 867)


  - > That’s something I made up. It means someone who neither hopes without reason, nor fears without reason, someone who constantly resists the overdramatic worldview. (location: 872)


  - > When women are educated, all kinds of wonderful things happen in societies. The workforce becomes diversified and able to make better decisions and solve more problems. Educated mothers decide to have fewer children and more children survive. More energy and time is invested in each child’s education. It’s a virtuous cycle of change. (location: 879)
    Straight out of moment of lift.

  - > The solution is not to balance out all the negative news with more positive news. That would just risk creating a self-deceiving, comforting, misleading bias in the other direction. It would be as helpful as balancing too much sugar with too much salt. It would make things more exciting, but maybe even less healthy. (location: 894)
    This is key. I always try to do this.

  - > The UN experts are not predicting that the number of children will stop increasing. They are reporting (location: 1064)


  - > Nothing drastic is needed. Just more of what we are already doing. The exact speed of the future drop is not possible to predict exactly. It depends on how fast these changes continue to happen. But in any case, the annual number of births in the world has already stopped increasing, which means that the period of fast population growth will soon be over. (location: 1078)


  - > people come up to me after the presentation and tell me that the charts can’t be correct because, you know, “People in Africa and Latin America still have many children. And religious people refuse contraceptives and still have huge families.” (location: 1121)


  - > If more children survive, the population just increases. Right? No! Completely wrong. (location: 1144)


  - > The only proven method for curbing population growth is to eradicate extreme poverty and give people better lives, including education and contraceptives. Across the world, parents then have chosen for themselves to have fewer children. (location: 1152)


  - >  (location: 1175)
    Growth by smil

  - > Most people’s incomes grow much slower than bacteria, unfortunately. Still, even if your income increases by only 2 percent a year, after 35 years it will have doubled. And then, if you maintain 2 percent growth, in another 35 years it will have doubled again. Over 200 years—if you lived that long—it would double six times, which is exactly what we saw in Sweden’s bubble trail in the last chapter, and which is typically the slow and steady way countries have moved from Level 1 to Level 4. (location: 1225)


  - > That’s life-changing for you. The world is extremely unfair, but doubling one’s income, from any starting point, is always life-changing. I use this doubling scale whenever I compare income because that’s how money works. (location: 1232)


  - > When we are afraid, we do not see clearly. I was a young doctor facing my first emergency, and I had always been terrified by the prospect of a third world war. As a child, I often had nightmares about it. I would wake up and run to my parents’ bed. I could be calmed only by my father going over the details of our plan one more time: we would take our tent in the bike trailer and go live in the woods where there were plenty of blueberries. (location: 1284)

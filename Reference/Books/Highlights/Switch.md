  - > People eat more when you give them a bigger container. Period.” (location: 49)


  - > And that’s the first surprise about change: What looks like a people problem is often a situation problem. (location: 64)


  - > Usually these topics are treated separately—there is “change management” advice for executives and “self-help” advice for individuals and “change the world” advice for activists. That’s a shame, because all change efforts have something in common: For anything to change, someone has to start acting differently. (location: 68)


  - > Think about the sheer magnitude of that change! Would anyone agree to work for a boss who’d wake you up twice a night, screaming, for trivial administrative duties? (And what if, every time you wore a new piece of clothing, the boss spit up on it?) Yet people don’t resist this massive change—they volunteer for it. (location: 73)
    Fascinating Example of change

  - > The problem is this: Often the heart and mind disagree. Fervently. (location: 84)
    The righteous mind

  - > If you want to change things, you’ve got to appeal to both. The Rider provides the planning and direction, and the Elephant provides the energy. (location: 128)


  - > Change is hard because people wear themselves out. And that’s the second surprise about change: What looks like laziness is often exhaustion. (location: 179)


  - > Let’s be honest: Most of us would not have tried what Stegner did. It would have been so easy, so natural, to make a presentation that spoke only to the Rider. (location: 202)
    How can i change the way i ask for changes?

  - > Remember that if you reach your colleagues’ Riders but not their Elephants, they will have direction without motivation. (location: 210)


  - > What looks like resistance is often a lack of clarity. (location: 221)


  - > Suddenly the intervention became razor-sharp. What behavior do we want to change? We want consumers to buy skim or 1% milk. When? When they’re shopping for groceries. Where? Duh. What else needs to change? Nothing (for now). (location: 234)
    Great example

  - > Don Berwick and his team catalyzed a change that saved 100,000 lives, yet Berwick himself wielded no power. He couldn’t change the law. He couldn’t fire hospital leaders who didn’t agree with him. He couldn’t pay bonuses to hospitals that accepted his proposals. (location: 319)
    This is mind  blowing and inspiring. Changes my assumption that i need cash for impact.

  - > He was designing an environment that made it more likely for hospital administrators to reform. Berwick also knew that behavior was contagious. He used peer pressure to persuade hospitals to join the campaign. (location: 333)


  - > In Sternin’s judgment, all of this analysis was “TBU”—true but useless. (location: 353)


  - > “Did you find any very, very poor kids who are bigger and healthier than the typical child?” The women, scanning the data, nodded and said, “Có, có, có.” (Yes, yes, yes.) (location: 358)
    Gathering and visualizibg data engages  both rider and elephant

  - > If some kids were healthy despite their disadvantages, that meant malnourishment was not inevitable. (location: 362)
    Small wins from power of habits

  - > Most important, it was their change, something that arose from the local wisdom of the village. Sternin’s role was only to help them see that they could do it, that they could conquer malnutrition on their own. (location: 395)


  - > By looking for bright spots within the very village he was trying to change, Sternin ensured that the solution would be a native one. (location: 403)
    I could do this with atomic about breaks

  - > Once they’ve helped patients identify specific and vivid signs of progress, they pivot to a second question, which is perhaps even more important. It’s the Exception Question: “When was the last time you saw a little bit of the miracle, even just for a short time?” (location: 491)
    I want to work on doing this with liv

  - > Bottom line: You are spending 80 percent of your time exploring Debbie’s success and finding ways to replicate it. You aren’t obsessing about the manager who was skeptical. You aren’t planning another training program with the same managers to review the material. You are simply asking yourself, “What’s working and how can we do more of it?” That’s the bright-spot philosophy in a single question. (location: 531)


  - > There is a clear asymmetry between the scale of the problem and the scale of the solution. Big problem, small solution. (location: 578)


  - > Instead, they are most often solved by a sequence of small solutions, sometimes over weeks, sometimes over decades. (location: 580)


  - > If the Rider spots a hole, he wants to fill it, and if he’s got a round hole with a 24-inch diameter, he’s gonna go looking for a 24-inch peg. (location: 582)


  - > Yet, in the real world, this obvious question is almost never asked. Instead, the question we ask is more problem focused: “What’s broken, and how do we fix it?” (location: 590)
    This is what neil and i need surfAce and improve what already works

  - > “What is the ratio of the time I spend solving problems to the time I spend scaling successes?” (location: 634)


  - > What happened here is decision paralysis. More options, even good ones, can freeze us and make us retreat to the default plan, which in this case was a painful and invasive hip-replacement surgery. This behavior clearly is not rational, but it is human. (location: 656)


  - > They scripted the critical move: Switch to 1% milk. (location: 737)


  - > When you want someone to behave in a new way, explain the “new way” clearly. Don’t assume the new moves are obvious. (location: 795)


  - > Food Pyramid, which specifies the types and quantities of food that make up a healthy diet, is the perfect example of how not to change people’s behavior. It’s worth considering for a moment, because what dooms the Pyramid could doom your efforts to create change in your life, as well. (location: 800)
    Wild. So true yet i never would have thought of thiz on my own

  - > The answers to more meaningful questions—How much? How often? What kind?—aren’t as easy to infer, which of course adds more ambiguity. (location: 808)
    What would a good pyrid look like?

  - > But the more successful change transformations were more likely to set behavioral goals: 89 percent of the top third versus only 33 percent of the bottom third. (location: 828)


  - > The parents are instructed to let the child lead the play session, and they’re forbidden to give commands, to criticize, even to ask questions. Letting their child direct the action is incredibly difficult for them. (location: 848)


  - > Parents are taught skills that feel unnatural at first. They are taught to look for opportunities to praise their kids’ behavior. (“I like how hard you’re working.” “Good job. You’re being very kind to that doll.”) They are taught to simply describe their child’s behavior, so that the child feels noticed. (“Oh, look, now you’re putting the car in the garage.”) (location: 865)


  - > Collins and Porras defined a BHAG as “an audacious 10-to-30-year goal to progress towards an envisioned future,” and their research showed that setting these big, motivating goals was a practice that distinguished lasting companies from less successful ones. (location: 993)


  - > You have a choice about how to use the Rider’s energy: By default, he’ll obsess about which way to move, or whether it’s necessary to move at all. But you can redirect that energy to helping you navigate toward the destination. For that to happen, you need a gut-smacking goal, one that appeals to both Rider and Elephant. Think of Esserman’s “under one roof” vision or of Crystal Jones’s challenge to her kids to become third graders. (location: 1069)


  - > The specificity of SMART goals is a great cure for the worst sins of goal setting—ambiguity and irrelevance (“We are going to delight our customers every day in every way!”). But SMART goals are better for steady-state situations than for change situations, because the assumptions underlying them are that the goals are worthwhile. (location: 1074)


  - > SMART goals presume the emotion; they don’t generate it. (location: 1078)


  - > Destination postcards do double duty: They show the Rider where you’re headed, and they show the Elephant why the journey is worthwhile. (location: 1084)


  - > Second, there’s a Path problem: The culture of the stock market encourages short-term thinking. (location: 1099)


  - > That means motivation probably isn’t our obstacle. (location: 1101)


  - > You need a black-and-white (B&W) goal. A B&W goal is an all-or-nothing goal, and it’s useful in times when you worry about backsliding. Maybe your B&W goal for your alcohol consumption could be “No wine ever.” No wiggle room there. And what if we changed our New Year’s resolution from “Be healthier” to “Gym every day” or even “No more Cheetos”? Those goals leave nowhere to hide. Either you’ve got damning orange Cheeto dust on your fingers or you don’t. (location: 1146)


  - > So the explorers’ instincts about the wells were correct—they knew the good ones from the bad ones. But there was information, especially for high-and low-probability wells, that they weren’t using. (location: 1175)


  - > Ian Vann, BP’s head of exploration at the time, figured out a way to eliminate the fudge room. He announced his new vision: “No dry holes.” (location: 1199)


  - > “The last defense of the charlatan is always that something is ‘strategic.’ ‘This is a strategic well, so we have to drill it.’” (location: 1218)


  - > You have to back up your destination postcard with a good behavioral script. That’s a recipe for success. What you don’t need to do is anticipate every turn in the road between today and the destination. (location: 1241)


  - > When you’re at the beginning, don’t obsess about the middle, because the middle is going to look different once you get there. Just look for a strong beginning and a strong ending and get moving. (location: 1244)


  - > The 125-call benchmark jolted the department, snapped it out of its lackadaisical attitude. Most of the analysts began working 12 to 15 hours per day, nearly every day of the year. (Note the clarity of the instructions—this is Rivkin’s 1% milk campaign.) (location: 1271)
    So bad this unhealthiness is glorified

  - > He provided a destination postcard (“I.I. or Die”), and he scripted some moves that would give his people a head start. He had the beginning right and the ending right, and when the Amgen situation popped up in the middle, the team was ready. (location: 1300)


  - > The problem was that Waters had almost no power to advance this “trend-right” vision. The merchants didn’t have to deal with her. “I had to win them over. I could never mandate, ‘We have to have purple this year because that’s the trend,’” she recalled. (location: 1340)


  - > In the analytical culture of Target, where numbers were the lingua franca, why did a bunch of demonstrations seem to make the difference? (location: 1366)
    weord tov see power of habits tell the other side of the story

  - > But when it comes time to change the behavior of other people, our first instinct is to teach them something. Smoking is really unhealthy! Your chemotherapy medicine is really important! We speak to the Rider when we should be speaking to the Elephant. (location: 1480)


  - > Why can’t we simply think our way into new behavior? The answer is that, in some cases, we really can’t trust our own thinking. (location: 1485)


  - > How can we dispel people’s positive illusions without raining down negativity on them? (location: 1511)


  - > “Turnaround leaders must convince people that the organization is truly on its deathbed—or, at the very least, that radical changes are required if the organization is to survive and thrive.” (location: 1568)


  - > Out of this human tragedy has emerged a rather ridiculous business cliché. When executives talk about the need for a “burning platform,” they mean, basically, that they need a way to scare their employees into changing. (location: 1581)


  - > Most of the big problems we encounter in organizations or society are ambiguous and evolving. They don’t look like burning-platform situations, where we need people to buckle down and execute a hard but well-understood game plan. To solve bigger, more ambiguous problems, we need to encourage open minds, creativity, and hope. (location: 1624)


  - > The maids who’d been told that they were good exercisers had lost an average of 1.8 pounds. That’s almost a half pound a week, which is a pretty substantial rate of loss. The other maids hadn’t lost any weight. (location: 1652)


  - > People find it more motivating to be partly finished with a longer journey than to be at the starting gate of a shorter one. (location: 1667)


  - > And here’s the main thing—it almost certainly would change the way you behave from that moment forward. Once you realized that exercise could come from little things, maybe you’d be on the lookout for ways to get a smidgen more active. (location: 1690)


  - > If you’re leading a change effort, you better start looking for those first two stamps to put on your team’s cards. Rather than focusing solely on what’s new and different about the change to come, make an effort to remind people what’s already been conquered. (location: 1697)


  - > If you want a reluctant Elephant to get moving, you need to shrink the change. (location: 1704)
    This is so damn smart

  - > Partly it’s because we fear that, in order to “clean house” properly, our work must (by definition) end with a house that’s clean. (location: 1711)


  - > I have learned that the math does need to work, but sometimes motivation is more important than math. This is one of those times…. Face it, if you go on a diet and lose weight the first week, you will stay on that diet. If you go on a diet and gain weight or go six weeks with no visible progress, you will quit. (location: 1751)


  - > Most financial advisers recommend that their clients pay down high-interest debt first in order to optimize the impact of their money. But Ramsey’s not trying to solve an optimization problem; he’s trying to solve an Elephant problem. The reason people get themselves into financial trouble, he knows, is that they lose control. They begin to feel powerless in the face of a mountain of debt. And you can’t combat powerlessness with math. You combat it by proving to people that they can win. (location: 1757)


  - > In essence, the department heads are exercising positive peer pressure on one another. It becomes the social norm to think of cuts from the perspective of the university as a whole (a strong, shared identity), rather than from the perspective of individual departments. (location: 1792)


  - > You want to select small wins that have two traits: (1) They’re meaningful. (2) They’re “within immediate reach,” as Bill Parcells said. And if you can’t achieve both traits, choose the latter! (The 5-Minute Room Rescue wasn’t very meaningful by itself, but it made great change possible.) (location: 1918)


  - > He says it’s critical to ask yourself, “What’s the next action?” (location: 1923)


  - > But here we’re seeing something different. Paul Butler didn’t shrink the change. Instead, he grew the people. He made the St. Lucians swell with pride over their parrot—a species that exists nowhere else. (location: 2003)


  - > It assumes that when we have a decision to make, we weigh the costs and benefits of our options and make the choice that maximizes our satisfaction. It’s a rational, analytical approach. This is the approach that Paul Butler knew would fail with St. Lucians, because there simply wasn’t a strong cost/benefit case for the parrot. In the identity model of decision making, we essentially ask ourselves three questions when we have a decision to make: Who am I? What kind of situation is this? What would someone like me do in this situation? (location: 2010)


  - > Because identities are central to the way people make decisions, any change effort that violates someone’s identity is likely doomed to failure. (location: 2026)


  - > Davis and Wood found that the nurses who stayed at the hospital were fiercely loyal to the profession of nursing. In other words, their satisfaction was an identity thing—the nobility of the nursing profession gave meaning to their work. (location: 2039)


  - > If their answer is no, then you’ll have to work hard to show them that they should aspire to a different self-image. (location: 2051)


  - > In a sense, signing the petition became evidence to the home owners that they were “concerned citizens,” and this subtle shift in identity led to a shift in their behavior. (location: 2105)


  - > It shows us that people are receptive to developing new identities, that identities “grow” from small beginnings. (location: 2119)


  - > These kids now believe that working hard was not something that made you vulnerable, but something that made you smarter.” (location: 2205)


  - > Tim Brown, the CEO of IDEO, says that every design process goes through “foggy periods.” One of IDEO’s designers even sketched out a “project mood chart” that predicts how people will feel at different phases of a project. It’s a U-shaped curve with a peak of positive emotion, labeled “hope,” at the beginning, and a second peak of positive emotion, labeled “confidence,” at the end. In between the two peaks is a negative emotional valley labeled “insight.” (location: 2223)


  - > Our brains and our abilities are like muscles. They can be strengthened with practice. (location: 2313)


  - > In a famous article, Stanford psychologist Lee Ross surveyed dozens of studies in psychology and noted that people have a systematic tendency to ignore the situational forces that shape other people’s behavior. He called this deep-rooted tendency the “Fundamental Attribution Error.” (location: 2342)


  - > If you want people to change, you can provide clear direction (Rider) or boost their motivation and determination (Elephant). Alternatively, you can simply make the journey easier. (location: 2360)


  - > Tweaking the environment is about making the right behaviors a little bit easier and the wrong behaviors a little bit harder. (location: 2388)


  - > In our experience, people who are trying to change things often reach instinctively for carrots and sticks. (location: 2400)


  - > What’s sadly typical about this story is that the executives didn’t initially look for a Path solution. Instead, they wanted to spook the Elephant by threatening to withhold a paycheck. Bregman says they were mentally stuck: “‘Well, I already asked them to do it. I taught them how to do it. I told them they had to do it. I don’t know what else to do!’” At that point, the executives felt they’d tried every tool in their toolbox, so they jumped to punishments. (location: 2412)

  - > Most of the adjectives used to describe growth are qualifiers of its rate: often it is not the growth per se that we worry about but rather its rate, either too fast or too slow. (location: 794)

  - > The relationship of body size to metabolic characteristics has long been a focus of animal studies, but only when metabolic scaling was extended to plants did it become possible to argue that the rates of biomass production and growth of all kinds of organisms, ranging from unicellular algae to the most massive vertebrates and trees, are proportional to metabolic rate, which scales as the ¾ power of body mass M (Damuth 2001). (location: 2092)


  - > And there are also polyextremophilic bacteria able to tolerate several extreme conditions. Perhaps the best example in this category is Deinococcus radiodurans, commonly found in soils, animal feces and sewage: it survives extreme doses of radiation, ultraviolet radiation, desiccation and freeze-drying thanks to its extraordinary capacity to repair damaged DNA (White et al. 1999; Cox and Battista 2005).

    What does this bacteria teach us about repair?

  - > Monod (1949) outlined the succession of phases in the growth of bacterial cultures: initial lag phase (no growth), acceleration phase (growth rate increasing), exponential phase (growth rate constant), retardation phase (growth rate slowing down), and stationary phase (once again, no growth, in this case as a result of nutrient depletion or presence of inhibitory products) followed by the death phase.

  - > WHO divides the progression of a pandemic into six phases (Rubin 2011). First, an animal influenza virus circulating among birds or mammals has not infected humans. Second, the infection occurs, creating a specific potential pandemic threat. Third, sporadic cases or small clusters of disease exist but there are no community-wide outbreaks. Such outbreaks mark the fourth phase. In the next phase, community-level outbreaks affect two or more countries (location: 2468)


  - > The tree is organized by the direction of its growing tips, the lignification [i.e. wood production] of the inner tissues, the upward flow of water in the lignified xylem, the downward passage of food in the phloem, and the continued growth of the cambium. It is kept alive, in spite of its increasing load of dead wood, by the activity of the skin of living cells. (location: 2522)


  - > At the extreme, a single old massive tree can add annually the same amount of carbon as is stored in an entire mid-sized tree, even as stand-level productivity is declining. (location: 2720)


  - > Net assessments of coming productivity changes remain highly uncertain even for well-studied forests of Europe and North America as faster growth may be largely or entirely negated by a higher frequency of fires, cyclones, (location: 2825)


  - > Centuries, even millennia, of no growth or marginal improvements preceded an eventual takeoff that was followed by a period of impressive gains that began in a few instances already during the 18th century, but much more commonly during the 19th and 20th centuries. While some of these exponential trajectories continue (albeit at often attenuated rates), recent decades have seen many of these growth phenomena approaching unmistakable plateaus, some even entering a period of (temporary or longer-lasting) decline. (location: 2949)


  - > Higher planting densities were made possible by hybrid improvements in stress tolerance but higher yields could not be achieved without requisite increases in fertilizer applications. (location: 3083)


  - > As a result, there is still no large-scale cultivation of transgenic wheat or rice. But the opposition is not based on solid scientific foundations. Klümper and Qaim (2014) examined all principal factors that influence outcomes of genetically modified cropping and their meta-analysis provided robust evidence of benefits for producers in both affluent and low-income countries. On average, the adoption of transgenic crops has reduced pesticide use by 37% while it increased crop yields by 22% and profits by 68%, and yield gains were larger for insect-resistant than for herbicide-tolerant crops, and they have been higher in low-income countries. (location: 3099)


  - > In contrast, world record harvests achieved on small plots under optimal growing conditions should not be taken as indicators of the potential growth of national or regional yields but as demonstrations of how close some of these performances have come to achievable photosynthetic maxima. (location: 3161)


  - > The best available long-term records for major crops other than staple grain follow the same general pattern of very long premodern yield stagnation followed by decades of linear growth made possible by better cultivars, adequate fertilization, use of pesticides and herbicides, mechanized harvesting and, in many cases, also by supplementary irrigation. (location: 3174)


  - > As expected, endotherms grow faster than ectotherms. Lines of the best fit show an order of magnitude difference between mammals and reptiles, and two orders of magnitude difference between fishes and altricial birds. (location: 3419)


  - > Growth rates increase with the rate of metabolism, but there are exceptions to this rule. (location: 3425)


  - > According to Cope’s rule, animal lineages should evolve toward larger body size over time. Increased body mass has been seen to offer several competitive advantages (increased defense against predation, more successful inter- and intraspecific competition, higher longevity, and more generalized diet) that should outweigh inevitable downsides, above all lower fecundity, longer gestation and development, and higher food and water needs (Schmidt-Nielsen 1984; Hone and Benton 2005). (location: 3440)


  - > Proclivity to taming, ability to reproduce in captivity, low or no aggressiveness and, with large species, easy herding were obvious selection criteria for domestication (Russell 2002). The growth cycle (time to reach sexual maturity), the rate of reproduction, the length of pregnancy and lactation, and the time to reach the slaughter weight were other key considerations. (location: 3491)


  - > No domesticated mammal can produce meat as efficiently as a pig, not because of its omnivory but because its basal metabolism is almost 40% lower than would be expected for its adult body weight. (location: 3510)


  - > While the proportions of human and pig bodies differ, adult masses are similar, and for Western men (whose normal body masses range mostly between 65 and 85 kg, in the same range as maturing pigs) it might be an instructive exercise trying to spend a day confined even to 2 m2, to say nothing about a third of that space! Usually more than 1,000 pigs are now kept under one roof in small stalls and pig production is highly concentrated. (location: 3523)


  - > Increasing growth through confinement has led to such restrictions on bird movement (both for broilers and egg-laying hens) that detestable would be the right adjective to label this practice. There are no legally binding density restrictions for American broilers but guidelines by the National Chicken Council specify just 560–650 cm2 per bird. The smaller area is easy to visualize, it is smaller than the standard A4 paper sheet, which measures 602 cm2, or a square with sides just short of 25 cm. (location: 3556)


  - > This crowding is also a perfect illustration of how maximization of profit drives growth even as that growth is not optimal. (location: 3562)


  - > shown that broilers convert feed more efficiently, grow heavier, and have lower mortality when given more space (Thaxton et al. 2006), but as Fairchild (2005) noted broiler farmers cannot afford low densities because they would not achieve a satisfactory return. Similarly, feeding efficiency and daily weight gain of pigs improve with lower stocking density, but the overall return (total meat sold) is marginally higher with the highest density. (location: 3563)


  - > Social inequality, manifested through inferior nutrition, has been a common cause of stunting in societies ranging from relatively rich 19th-century Switzerland (Schoch et al. 2012) to China of the early 21st century, where even the rapid pace of modernization had still left many children behind.

    Why did these take off?

  - > Diesel fuel has nearly 12% higher energy density compared to gasoline, (location: 4563)


  - > But diesels are also inherently more efficient: the self-ignition of heavier fuel (no sparking needed) requires much higher compression ratios (commonly twice as high as in gasoline engines) and that results in a more complete combustion (and hence a cooler exhaust gas). (location: 4564)


  - > Diesel envisaged the engine as the key enabler of industrial decentralization, a shift of production from crowded large cities where, he felt strongly, it was based on inappropriate economic, political, humanitarian, and hygienic grounds (R. Diesel 1893). (location: 4571)


  - > As a result, ceilings were opened to natural light or to installation of electric lighting and adequate heating and (later) air conditioning; highly efficient motors also allowed individualized precision control, machines and workstations could be switched on and off without affecting the entire system, and expansion or machine upgrading could be handled easily by requisite rewiring. Electric drive was a key factor in the near-doubling of US manufacturing productivity during the first 30 years of the 20th century, as well as in another doubling that was accomplished by the late 1960s (Schurr 1984). (location: 4911)


  - > Other commonly owned appliances powered by small electric motors include clothes dryers, dishwashers, and heating, ventilation and air-conditioning equipment (including heat recovery ventilators that run nonstop in highly insulated homes, as do natural gas furnace fans when the heating cycle is on). (location: 4924)


  - > In cars, small electric motors start engines, enable power steering, run water pumps, operate antilock brakes, seatbelt retractors and windshield wipers, adjust seats, run heating and air-conditioning fans, open and close windows, door locks, and now also sliding doors, lift gates, and fold in side mirrors. (location: 4939)


  - > The vast domain of artifacts (equivalent to all Eukarya, organisms with nuclei in their cells) would contain the kingdom (equivalent to Animalia) of multi-component man-made objects (as opposed to single-component artifacts made solely of metal or wood or plastic) in which we would find the phylum (equivalent of Chordata) of electricity-powered devices, one of whose classes (equivalent to Mammalia) would be portable designs, containing an order of devices (equivalent to Cetacea) used for communication, within which would be the family of phones (equivalent to Delphinidae) composed of many genera of mobile phones (Alcatel, Apple, Huawei, Motorola … equivalent to Delphinus, Orcinus, Tursiops …), some of which contain a single species (equivalent to Orcinus orca, killer whale), others (most notably Samsung, (location: 4970)


  - > Qualitative changes were even slower in coming: the 1954 census found only 26% of French homes with an indoor toilet and only 10% with a bathtub, shower, or central heating, while 42% still did not have even running water (Prost 1991). (location: 5396)


  - > Societies have usually had much better success in building the essential infrastructures than maintaining them, and regular American assessments clearly demonstrate that chronic shortcoming. In 2017 the biennial Infrastructure Report Card published by the American Society of Civil Engineers awarded D+ as the overall grade, with individual categories ranging from B for railroads to D for drinking water, inland waterways, levees, and roads, and D− for public transit (ASCE 2017).

  - > But as I will quantify these well-known phenomena, it will become clear how rapidly those modern improvements reached saturation levels, and how these new plateaus were dictated mostly not by technical barriers but by economic or environmental considerations. Consequently, recent advances have concentrated on making long-distance transport cheaper and more reliable rather than faster, but some sectors have still seen important but questionable attempts to raise overall capacity (larger container ships, cruise ships of unprecedented size, the double-decked Airbus 380). (location: 5853)


  - > The capacity of all trains is obviously limited by the power of their prime movers, be they locomotives pulling the trains or, as in shinkansen, multiple electric motors in carriages. And the most obvious economic consideration determining the capacity of passenger trains is the frequency of connections. That is, in turn, heavily dependent on the population density of the regions served by trains and by the compromise between passenger comfort, accessibility, and operating cost (Connor 2011). (location: 5922)


  - > As in the case of steam-powered trains, we have to distinguish between maximum speeds attained by vehicles designed to set new records and typical speeds in urban and intercity traffic. In the latter case, other, more important, considerations (above all costs and safety) restrict the maximum speeds to levels that were first reached during the early stages of automotive development. The relation between speed and fuel consumption is distinctly U-shaped, with cars operating less efficiently at both very low and high speeds. There is a relatively narrow optimum range of speed, centered on 60 km/h, for the most economic driving. (location: 5946)


  - > Moreover, once the evaluation is done in an all-encompassing manner, the realities of modern economies have resulted in the very opposite outcome. Illich (1974) showed that after accounting for the time required to earn money for buying (or leasing) the car, fueling, maintaining, and insuring it, the average speed of American car travel shrank to less than 8 km/h in the early 1970s, and I have calculated that by the year 2000 the speed declined to less than 5 km/h, no faster than walking or of horse-drawn omnibuses more than a century ago.

Hybrid vehicles have made some significant inroads, but the greatest uncertainty concerns the market penetration of new electric cars, with available forecasts ranging from imminent rapid adoption to a gradual introduction. (location: 5973)


  - > All of these planes could be engineered to fly faster but additional drag generated as they surpass 1 M would make them significantly more expensive to operate: a speed plateau dictated by the economics of commercial operation has been thus in place ever since the beginning of the jetliner era.

  - > Hertz’s motivation was to confirm Maxwell’s theory and his findings were soon translated into wireless telegraphy (first short-range trials by Oliver J. Lodge and Alexander S. Popov in 1894 and 1895, the first transatlantic transmission by Guglielmo Marconi in 1901) and broadcasts of voice and music (first long-distance transmissions by Reginald A. Fessenden in 1906). After WWI came public radio broadcasts (first licenses in the early 1920s), black and white television (experimental broadcast in 1929, scheduled broadcasts in the US and the UK during the 1930s), and radar (Robert Watson-Watt in 1935), and after WWII into the first electronic computers, color TV, (location: 6075)


  - > Transistors, integrated circuits, and microprocessors made it possible to design and produce new kinds of affordable electronic devices whose mass-scale ownership, growing capabilities, and increasing reliabilities resulted in unprecedented personal access to information, to a still expanding range of services and entertainment, and eventually allowed instant global communication and sharing of knowledge—while also enabling new forms of criminality and fostering a ubiquitous loss of privacy.

  - > Unprecedented agglomerations of people and economic activities must be supplied incessantly with enormous, and rising, amounts of energy in order to satisfy their high power-density demand, food to sustain record-size concentrations of humanity, and raw materials to build, maintain and renew many required infrastructures, ranging from water supply and wastewater treatment to roads and garbage collection. Resource demands created by urbanization have been enormous as virtually all per capita consumption rates always rise, (location: 7138)


  - > Inevitably, urbanization demanding concentrated higher levels of per capita resource consumption creates commensurate environmental burdens. (location: 7194)


  - > The highest share of the urban population (more than a third) is living in cities surrounded by cultivated ecosystems where their expansion reduces the area of arable land. Urban sprawl causes extensive loss of natural plant cover, erases biodiversity, fragments habitats, reduces the area of high-quality arable land, and disrupts streams (as they are forced into concrete troughs or even disappear), and in arid areas results in overuse of groundwater. (location: 7200)


  - > Urban growth has also created impervious surface areas (ISAs)—that is roofed and paved surfaces (roads, sidewalks, and parking lots) and above-ground storages of materials—that are devoid of any vegetation and prevent water absorption. These areas contribute to excessive runoff during major precipitation events and reduce the diversity and abundance of aquatic organisms. (location: 7218)


  - > In 2015, 24 of the 31 megacities were in low-income countries (the global “South,” as the UN calls it), with Asia having 18, China six, and India five. New York, the largest Western city, was relegated to 10th place, and Moscow, the largest European city, ranked 22nd and Paris 25th, another clear indicator of Europe’s diminishing global importance. (location: 7294)


  - > All megacities, regardless of their developmental stage, face the challenges of worrisome income inequality, poor living conditions for their low-income families, and inadequate and decaying infrastructures (most often evident in the state of public transportation). In addition, emerging megacities in low-income countries share serious to severe environmental problems (including crowding, air pollution, water pollution, and solid waste disposal), high unemployment levels (alleviated by extensive black economy sectors), and public safety concerns. (location: 7312)


  - > Earthquakes and cyclones (hurricanes, typhoons) are the most widespread risks, but in some megacities a considerable number of fatalities could be also caused by heat waves and by storm surges (aggravated by the rising sea level) and volcanic eruptions. Increasing numbers of tall buildings also raise the risk of skyscraper conflagrations: as London’s 2017 Grenfell Tower destruction demonstrated, they are very difficult to control once the fire begins to spread. (location: 7325)

And the Roman Empire’s longevity was not that much greater than the durability of its contemporaries: its 503 years compare to 427 years of Han rule and 425 years of the Sassanid Empire. (location: 7701)


  - > That imperial longevity—more than 3.5 millennia of continuous governance over a fluctuating territory which had nearly always included the core area along the middle and lower Huang He and most of whose population always spoke the same language—is unparalleled in history. Even more remarkable is how this enduring configuration survived into the 21st century. (location: 7772)

Synthesis of ammonia requires just 1% of global energy use but the application of nitrogen fertilizers has enabled us to grow about 40% of the current global food supply, and about 50% of China’s crop harvest. Stated inversely, two out of every five people alive (and every second person in China) is now adequately fed thanks to the Haber-Bosch synthesis of ammonia. (location: 8020)

In 1928 the richest 1% of households claimed 28% of all income, by 1950 it was just above 10%. The second stage lasted just over 30 years: widely shared prosperity further lowered the top 1% share to below 10% by the late 1970s and income gaps did not widen. Finally, that changed as economic growth slowed down and as the incomes of households in the middle and lower brackets slowed appreciably while those of households at the top continued to rise. Piketty et al. (2018) concluded that in the US the top 1% share increased by two-thirds since 1960 and that it had doubled since 1980. (location: 8866)

The closed economy of the future might similarly be called the “spaceman” economy, in which the earth has become a single spaceship, without unlimited reservoirs of anything, either for extraction or for pollution, and in which, therefore, man must find his place in a cyclical ecological system which is capable of continuous reproduction of material form even though it cannot escape having inputs of energy. The difference between the two types of economy becomes most apparent in the attitude towards consumption. In the cowboy economy, consumption is regarded as a good thing and production likewise … By contrast, in the spaceman economy, throughput is by no means a desideratum, and is indeed to be regarded as something to be minimized rather than maximized … This idea that both production and consumption are bad things rather than good things is very strange to economists … (Boulding 1966, 7–8) (location: 9933)

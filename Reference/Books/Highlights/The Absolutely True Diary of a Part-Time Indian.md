  - > So I draw because I want to talk to the world. And I want the world to pay attention to me. (location: 84)


  - > Almost all of the rich and famous brown people are artists. (location: 87)


  - > I think the world is a series of broken dams and floods, and my cartoons are tiny little lifeboats. (location: 88)


  - > We Indians really should be better liars, considering how often we’ve been lied to. (location: 114)


  - > Poverty doesn’t give you strength or teach you lessons about perseverance. No, poverty only teaches you how to be poor. (location: 149)


  - > Really. I think my mother sometimes wants to haul off and give me a slap, but my father won’t let it happen. He doesn’t believe in physical punishment; he believes in staring so cold at me that I turn into a ice-covered ice cube with an icy filling. My house is a safe place, so Rowdy spends most of his time with us. It’s like he’s a family member, an extra brother and son. (location: 173)


  - > Maybe she was trapped in those romances. (location: 379)


  - > “The world, even the smallest parts of it, is filled with things you don’t know.” (location: 911)


  - > There are all kinds of addicts, I guess. We all have pain. And we all look for ways to make the pain go away. (location: 1003)


  - > If you let people into your life a little bit, they can be pretty damn amazing. (location: 1187)


  - > “I know, I know, but some Indians think you have to act white to make your life better. Some Indians think you become white if you try to make your life better, if you become successful.” (location: 1200)


  - > “Well, life is a constant struggle between being an individual and being a member of the community.” (location: 1208)


  - > “The quality of a man’s life is in direct proportion to his commitment to excellence, regardless of his chosen field of endeavor.” (location: 1365)


  - > There are white parents, especially fathers, who never come to the school. They don’t come for their kids’ games, concerts, plays, or carnivals. I’m friends with some white kids, and I’ve never met their fathers. That’s absolutely freaky. (location: 1399)


  - > I’ve learned that white people, especially fathers, are good at hiding in plain sight. I mean, yeah, my dad would sometimes go on a drinking binge and be gone for a week, but those white dads can completely disappear without ever leaving the living room. They can just BLEND into their chairs. They become their chairs. (location: 1403)


  - > I mean, like in many cultures, men were viewed as warriors and women were viewed as caregivers. But gay people, being both male and female, were seen as both warriors and caregivers. Gay people could do anything. They were like Swiss Army knives! My grandmother had no use for all the gay bashing and homophobia in the world, especially among other Indians. “Jeez,” she said. “Who cares if a man wants to marry another man? All I want to know is who’s going to pick up all the dirty socks?” Of course, ever since white people showed up and brought along their Christianity and their fears of eccentricity, Indians have gradually lost all of their tolerance. (location: 1419)


  - > Everybody loved her; she loved everybody. (location: 1436)


  - > I think all of us are always five years old in the presence and absence of our parents. (location: 1440)


  - > “Drinking would shut down my seeing and my hearing and my feeling,” she used to say. “Why would I want to be in the world if I couldn’t touch the world with all of my senses intact?” Well, my grandmother has left this world and she’s now roaming around the afterlife. (location: 1457)


  - > Do you know how many white strangers show up on Indian reservations every year and start telling Indians how much they love them? Thousands. It’s sickening. And boring. (location: 1486)


  - > In one of his plays, Medea says, “What greater grief than the loss of one’s native land?” I read that and thought, “Well, of course, man. We Indians have LOST EVERYTHING. We lost our native land, we lost our languages, we lost our songs and dances. We lost each other. We only know how to lose and be lost.” (location: 1557)


  - > The world is only broken into two tribes: The people who are assholes and the people who are not.” (location: 1588)


  - > I made a list of my favorite books: 1. The Grapes of Wrath 2. Catcher in the Rye (location: 1609)


  - > 3. Fat Kid Rules the World 4. Tangerine 5. Feed 6. Catalyst 7. Invisible Man 8. Fools Crow 9. Jar of Fools (location: 1611)


  - > I kept making list after list of the things that made me feel joy. And I kept drawing cartoons of the things that made me angry. I keep writing and rewriting, drawing and redrawing, and rethinking and revising and reediting. It became my grieving ceremony. (location: 1622)


  - > I guess that’s what it comes down to. The power of expectations. And as they expected more of me, I expected more of myself, and it just grew and grew until I was scoring twelve points a game. AS A FRESHMAN! (location: 1635)


  - > I was a nervous yucker in Reardan. Back in Wellpinit, I was a scared yucker. (location: 1646)


  - > So many ghosts. (location: 1730)


  - > Do you understand how amazing it is to hear that from an adult? Do you know how amazing it is to hear that from anybody? It’s one of the simplest sentences in the world, just four words, but they’re the four hugest words in the world when they’re put together. You can do it. I can do it. Let’s do it. (location: 1735)


  - > I knew that seven or eight of those Indians lived with drunken mothers and fathers. I knew that one of those Indians had a father who dealt crack and meth. I knew two of those Indians had fathers in prison. I knew that none of them was going to college. Not one of them. And I knew that Rowdy’s father was probably going to beat the crap out of him for losing this game. (location: 1810)


  - > We all cried in the locker room for hours. Coach cried, too. I guess that’s the only time that men and boys get to cry and not get punched in the face. (location: 1821)


  - > But there’s nobody who has been to more than five funerals. All my white friends can count their deaths on one hand. (location: 1838)


  - > The unhappy part? About 90 percent of the deaths have been because of alcohol. Gordy gave me this book by a Russian dude named Tolstoy, who wrote: “Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” Well, I hate to argue with a Russian genius, but Tolstoy didn’t know Indians. And he didn’t know that all Indian families are unhappy for the same exact reason: the fricking booze. (location: 1840)


  - > I know that death is never added to death; it multiplies. But still, I couldn’t stay and watch all of those people get drunk. I couldn’t do it. If you’d given me a room full of sober Indians, crying and laughing and telling stories about my sister, then I would have gladly stayed and joined them in the ceremony. But everybody was drunk. Everybody was unhappy. And they were drunk and unhappy in the same exact way. (location: 1980)


  - > I walked inside, into the crowded hallways, and all sorts of boys and girls, and teachers, came up and hugged me and slapped my shoulder and gave me little punches in the belly. They were worried for me. They wanted to help me with my pain. I was important to them. I mattered. Wow. All of these white kids and teachers, who were so suspicious of me when I first arrived, had learned to care about me. Maybe some of them even loved me. And I’d been so suspicious of them. And now I care about a lot of them. And loved a few of them. (location: 1984)


  - > But I was crying for my tribe, too. I was crying because I knew five or ten or fifteen more Spokanes would die during the next year, and that most of them would die because of booze. (location: 2009)


  - > Reservations were meant to be prisons, you know? Indians were supposed to move onto reservations and die. We were supposed to disappear. But somehow or another, Indians have forgotten that reservations were meant to be death camps. I wept because I was the only one who was brave and crazy enough to leave the rez. I was the only one with enough arrogance. I wept and wept and wept because I knew that I was never going to drink and because I was never going to kill myself and because I was going to have a better life out in the white world. (location: 2011)


  - > I realized that, sure, I was a Spokane Indian. I belonged to that tribe. But I also belonged to the tribe of American immigrants. And to the tribe of basketball players. And to the tribe of bookworms. And the tribe of cartoonists. And the tribe of chronic masturbators. And the tribe of teenage boys. And the tribe of small-town kids. And the tribe of Pacific Northwesterners. And the tribe of tortilla chips-and-salsa lovers. And the tribe of poverty. And the tribe of funeral-goers. And the tribe of beloved sons. And the tribe of boys who really missed their best friends. It was a huge realization. And that’s when I knew that I was going to be okay. But it also reminded me of the people who were not going to be okay. It made me think of Rowdy. I missed him so much. (location: 2017)


  - > Me, I don’t think anybody should be swimming in there now. But people forget. They forget good things and they forget bad things. They forget that lakes can catch on fire. They forget that dead horses can magically vanish and reappear. (location: 2089)


  - > “Well, the thing is, I don’t think Indians are nomadic anymore. Most Indians, anyway.” “No, we’re not,” I said. “I’m not nomadic,” Rowdy said. “Hardly anybody on this rez is nomadic. Except for you. You’re the nomadic one.” “Whatever.” “No, I’m serious. I always knew you were going to leave. I always knew you were going to leave us behind and travel the world. I had this dream about you a few months ago. You were standing on the Great Wall of China. You looked happy. And I was happy for you.” Rowdy didn’t cry. But I did. “You’re an old-time nomad,” Rowdy said. “You’re going to keep moving all over the world in search of food and water and grazing land. That’s pretty cool.” (location: 2150)


  - > I hoped and prayed that they would someday forgive me for leaving them. I hoped and prayed that I would someday forgive myself for leaving them. (location: 2159)


  - > I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve. Jesus, does anyone? (location: 2249)


  - > Ha! Yeah, it’s good to laugh. It’s good to tease. We’re Indians. So we know that teasing can be an act of love. (location: 2254)


  - > But have you ever heard about people becoming best friends at first sight? Have you ever heard of two Indian boys becoming instant best friends? Becoming best friends the first time they ever talk to each other? (location: 2286)


  - > But he would also give me advice. He’d challenge me. This one time, he said, “Junior, you fall in love too easy.” And, oh man, he was right about that. (location: 2319)


  - > And so I started to believe that I was good. I started to believe I was great. More than that, I started to believe that a little Indian boy like me could compete against white people. Do you remember how it felt to be so Indian and so poor and so powerless? And it felt like you would lose to white people? That you’d always lose to white people? Well, Randy didn’t believe that. And he wouldn’t let me believe it, either. He wouldn’t let me believe I was inferior to white people. Or to other Indians. (location: 2324)


  - > Have you ever noticed that the only people who say that money isn’t everything are the people who already have plenty of money? (location: 2528)

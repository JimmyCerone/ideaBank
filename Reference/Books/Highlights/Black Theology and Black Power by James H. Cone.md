  - > African-Americans, it seemed to me at the time, had assumed that, though whites did not treat them right, there was nothing wrong with whites' thinking about God. (location: 29)


  - > The white man has taught us to shout and sing and pray until we die, to wait until death, for some dreamy heaven-in-the-hereafter, when we're dead, while this white man has his milk and honey in the streets paved with golden dollars here on this earth! (location: 35)


  - > burning theological question was, how can I reconcile Christianity and Black Power, Martin Luther King, Jr.'s idea of nonviolence and Malcolm X's `by any means necessary' philosophy? The writing of Black Theology and Black Power was the beginning of my search for a resolution of that dilemma. (location: 42)


  - > Since theology is human speech and not God speaking, I recognize today, as I did then, that all attempts to speak about ultimate reality are limited by the social history of the speaker.Thus, (location: 46)


  - > Enough is enough! It is time for this mess to stop! (location: 62)


  - > An example of the weakness of the 1960s black freedom movement, as defined by Black Theology and Black Power, was its complete blindness to the problem of sexism, especially in the black church community. When I read my book today, I am embarrassed by its sexist language and patriarchal perspective. There is not even one reference to a woman in the whole book ! With black women playing such a dominant role in the African-American liberation struggle, past and present, how could I have been so blind? (location: 63)


  - > Whites have learned how to use less offensive language, but they have not changed the power relations between blacks and whites in the society. Because of the process of changing their language, combined with the token presence of middle-class African-Americans in their institutions, it is now even more difficult to define the racist behavior of whites. (location: 71)


  - > Amnesia is an enemy of justice. We must never forget what we once were lest we repeat our evil deeds in new forms. I do not want to forget that I was once silent about the oppression of women in the church and the society. Silence gives support to the powers that be. (location: 77)


  - > school, I knew that the time had come for me to make a decisive break with my theological mentors. But that was easier said than done. (location: 82)


  - > That criticism was totally unexpected, and it shook me as nothing else had. I had expected my black brothers and sisters to support me in my attacks on white theology. (location: 90)


  - > Barth's assertion of the word of God in op-position to natural theology in the context of Germany during the 1930s may have been useful. (location: 95)


  - > As in 1969, I still regard Jesus Christ today as the chief focus of my perspective on God but not to the exclusion of other religious perspectives. God's reality is not bound by one manifestation of the divine in Jesus but can be found wherever people are being empowered to fight for freedom. Life-giving power for the poor and the oppressed is the primary criterion that we must use to judge the adequacy of our theology, not abstract concepts. As Malcolm X put it: "I believe in a religion that believes in freedom. Any time I have to accept a religion that won't let me fight a battle for my people, I say to hell with that religion. (location: 98)


  - > My failure to link black liberation theology to the global struggles for freedom contributed to my blindness regarding the problem of classism. Class privilege was (and still is) a dominant reality in the white community of the United States as wel as in the African-American community. In fact, the problem of oppression in the world today is defined not exclusively in terms of race but also in terms of the great economic gap between rich and poor nations and the haves and havenots within them. (location: 117)


  - > They saw the great limitations of capitalism and, while rejecting the anti-democratic and atheistic principles of the Soviet Union, Martin and Malcolm began to search for the human, democratic side of socialism. (location: 122)


  - > It is, rather, Christ's central message to twentieth-century America. And unless the empirical denominational church makes a determined effort to recapture the man Jesus through a total identification with the suffering poor as expressed in Black Power, that church will become exactly what Christ is not. (location: 156)


  - > Churchmen, laymen and ministers alike, apparently fail to recognize their contribution to the ghetto condition through permissive silence—except for a few resolutions which they usually pass once a year or immediately following a riot—and through their cotenancy of a dehumanizing social structure whose existence depends on the continued enslavement of black people. (location: 160)


  - > It must become prophetic, demanding a radical change in the interlocking structures of this society. (location: 164)


  - > Feeling may twist judgment, but the lack of it may twist it even more class.2 (location: 174)


  - > "To aid in the destruction of America as he knows it." (location: 183)


  - > The term "Black Power" was first used in the civil rights movement in the spring of 1966 by Stokely Carmichael to designate the only appropriate response to white racism.1 (location: 195)
    Kendi writes about this.

  - > In fact the ability to probe for deeper meanings of words as they relate to various manifestations of reality is what makes the intellectual pursuit interesting and worthwhile. (location: 201)


  - > Black Power, then, is a humanizing force because it is the black man's attempt to affirm his being, his attempt to be recognized as "Thou," in spite of the "other,"9 the white power which dehumanizes him. The structure of white society attempts to make "black being" into "nonbeing" or "nothingness." (location: 225)


  - > The rebellion in the cities, far from being an expression of the inhumanity of blacks, is an affirmation of their being despite the ever-present possibility of death. For the black man to accept the white society's appeal to wait or to be orderly is to affirm "something which is less than essential . . . being." (location: 231)


  - > This is Black Power, the power of the black man to say Yes to his own "black being," and to make the other accept him or be prepared for a struggle. (location: 246)


  - > But many whites would reply : "The Negro is no longer bought and sold as chattel. We changed his status after the Civil War. Now he is free." Whatever may have been the motives of Abraham Lincoln and other white Americans for launching the war, it certainly was not on behalf of black people. (location: 267)
    Still same response 60 years later.

  - > "How should I respond to a world which defines me as a nonperson?" That he is a person is beyond question, not debatable. But when he attempts to relate as a person, the world demands that he respond as a thing. In this existential absurdity, what should he do? Should (location: 292)


  - > The response to this feeling of absurdity is determined by a man's ontological perspective. If one believes that this world is the extent of reality, he will either despair or rebel. (location: 294)


  - > From this standpoint the response of Black Power is like Camus's view of the rebel. One who embraces Black Power does not despair and take suicide as an out, nor does he appeal to another world in order to relieve the pains of. this one.25 Rather, he fights back with the whole of his being. (location: 300)


  - > One of the most serious charges leveled against the advocates of Black Power is that they are black racists. Many well-intentioned persons have insisted that there must be another approach, one which will not cause so much hostility, not to mention rebellion. Therefore appeal is made to the patience of black people to keep their "cool" and not get too carried away by their feelings. These men argue that if any progress is to be made, it will be through a careful, rational approach to the subject. (location: 306)
    Letter to Birmingham and crucial conversations.

  - > Black Power, in this respect, is by nature irrational, i.e., does not deny the role of rational reflection, but insists that human existence cannot be mechanized or put into neat boxes according to reason. (location: 311)


  - > It should be obvious that the hate which black people feel toward whites is not due to the creation of the term "Black Power." Rather, it is a result of the deliberate and systematic ordering of society on the basis of racism, making black alienation not only possible but inevitable. For over three hundred years black people have been enslaved by the tentacles of American white power, (location: 320)


  - > "One envies what he does not have, while the rebel's aim is to defend what he is. He does not merely claim some good that he does not possess or of which he is deprived. His aim is to claim recognition for something which he has." (location: 327)


  - > Therefore it is not the intention of the black man to repudiate his master's human dignity, but only his status as master.27 (location: 329)


  - > The surviving Jews had one, big, soul-wracking "incident" that wrenched them back to group identification. The surviving Negroes experience constant jolts that almost never let them forget for even an hour that they are Negroes. In this situation, hatred of whites and group identification are natural reactions.29 (location: 344)


  - > Black racism is a myth created by whites to ease their guilt feelings. As long as whites can be assured that blacks are racists, they can find reasons to justify their own oppression of' black people. (location: 352)


  - > If integration means accepting the white man's style, his values, or his religion, then the black man must refuse. (location: 380)


  - > On the other hand, if integration means that each man meets the other on equal footing, with neither possessing the ability to assert the rightness of his style over the other, then mutual meaningful dialogue is possible. Biblically, this may be called the Kingdom of God. Men were not created for separation, and color is not the essence of man's humanity. (location: 384)


  - > "The worst crime the white man has committed," writes Malcolm X, "has been to teach us to hate ourselves." (location: 400)


  - > Since integration is only a one-way street that Negroes travel to a white institution, then inherent in the situation itself is the implied inferiority of the black man. 37 (location: 412)


  - > It is indeed interesting that they, the oppressors, should ask this question, since whatever response blacks make is nothing but a survival reaction to white oppression. (location: 423)


  - > Furthermore, it is white intellectual arrogance which assumes that it has a monopoly on intelligence and moral judgment. How else can one explain the shocked indignation when the Kerner Report declared that race prejudice has shaped our history decisively. After all, Baldwin, Wright, Du Bois, and a host of other black writers had been saying for decades that racism is woven into the whole pattern of American society. (location: 433)


  - > The real menace in white intellectual arrogance is the dangerous assumption that the structure that enslaves is the structure that will also decide when and how this slavery is to be abolished. (location: 437)


  - > This probably accounts for white appeals to nonviolence and Christian love. (location: 445)


  - > There is no Negro problem in America; there has never been a Negro problem in America—the problem of race in America is a white problem. (location: 453)


  - > We learn nothing really from a study of Harlem. To understand Harlem we must go not to Harlem but to the conscience of "good white people"; we must ask not what is Harlem but what have you made of Harlem? Why did you create it and why do you need it?39 (location: 455)


  - > Racism is possible because whites are indifferent to suffering and patient with cruelty. (location: 490)


  - > They must believe that blacks are in poverty because they are lazy or because they are inferior. Yes, they must believe that everything is basically all right. Black Power punctures those fragile lies, declaring to white America the pitiless indictment of Francis Jeanson: "If you succeed in keeping yourself unsullied, it is because others dirty themselves in your place. (location: 511)


  - > But when blacks rise up in freedom, whites show their racism. (location: 518)


  - > The liberal, then, is one who sees "both sides" of the issue and shies away from "extremism" in any form. He wants to change the heart of the racist without ceasing to be his friend; he wants progress without conflict. (location: 534)


  - > A man is free when he accepts the responsibility for his own acts and knows that they involve not merely himself but all men. No one can "give" or "help get" freedom in that sense. (location: 548)


  - > In this picture the liberal can find no place. His favorite question when backed against the wall is "What can I do?" One (location: 549)


  - > "What can I do and still receive the same privileges as other whites and---this is the key—be liked by Negroes?" Indeed the only answer is "Nothing." However, (location: 551)


  - > However, there are places in the Black Power picture for "radicals," that is, for men, white or black, who are prepared to risk life for freedom. (location: 552)


  - > Black Power then is an expression of hope, not hope that whites will change the structure of oppression, but hope in the humanity of black people. (location: 558)


  - > This analysis is essentially correct. But to point out the futility of black rebellion is to miss the point. Black people know that they comprise less than 12 per cent of the total American population and are proportionately much weaker with respect to economic, political, and military power. And black radicals know that they represent a minority within the black community. But having tasted freedom through an identification with God's intention for humanity, they will stop at nothing in expressing their distaste for white power. To be sure, they may be the minority (location: 568)


  - > There is, then, a desperate need for a black theology, a theology whose sole purpose is to apply the freeing power of the gospel to black people under white oppression. (location: 587)


  - > These new theologians of the "Third world" argue that Christians should not shun violence but should initiate it, if violence is the only means of achieving the much needed rapid radical changes in life under dehumanizing systems. (location: 591)


  - > They are not confident, as most theologians from industrialized nations seem to be, that changes in the economic structure (from agrarian to industrial) of a country will lead to changes in its oppressive power-structure. (America (location: 592)
    Balaji and others seem so confident that simply exporting the us system will fix things (plus elephant and tiger)

  - > Unfortunately, Christianity came to the black man through white oppressors who demanded that he reject his concern for this world as well as his blackness and affirm the next world and whiteness. The black intellectual community, however, with its emphasis on black identity, is becoming increasingly suspicious of Christianity because the oppressor has used it as a means of stiffing the oppressed concern for present inequities. (location: 608)


  - > In contrast to many religions, Christianity revolves around a Person, without whom its existence ceases to be. (location: 624)


  - > Therefore Barth is best known for his relentless, devastating attack on natural theology, which seeks knowledge of God through reason alone, independent of Jesus Christ. (location: 628)


  - > Jesus' work is essentially one of liberation. Becoming a slave himself, he opens realities of human existence formerly closed to man. Through an encounter with Jesus, man now knows the full meaning of God's action in history and man's place within it. (location: 645)


  - > Indeed, the message of the Kingdom strikes at the very center of man's desire to define his own existence in the light of his own interest at the price of his brother's enslavement. (location: 649)


  - > Jesus had little toleration for the middle or upperclass religious snob whose attitude attempted to usurp the sovereignty of God and destroy the dignity of the poor. The Kingdom is for the poor and not the rich because the former has nothing to expect from the world while the latter's entire existence is grounded in his commitment to worldly things. (location: 661)


  - > But those who recognize their utter dependence on God and wait on him despite the miserable absurdity of life are typically the poor, according to Jesus. And the Kingdom which the poor may enter is not merely an eschatological longing for escape to a transcendent reality, nor is it an inward serenity which eases unbearable suffering. Rather, it is God encountering man in the very depths of his being-in-the-world and releasing him from all human evils, like racism, which hold him captive. (location: 665)


  - > One must serve through bodily, social and political obedience the liberation of the suffering creation out of real affliction.... Consequently, the missionary proclamation of the cross of the Resurrected One is not an opium of the people which intoxicates and incapacitates, but the ferment of new freedom. (location: 673)


  - > Jesus is not safely confined in the first century. He is our contemporary, proclaiming release to the captives and rebelling against all who silently accept the structures of injustice. (location: 685)


  - > As long as man is a slave to another power, he is not free to serve God with mature responsibility. He is not free to become what he is—human. (location: 702)


  - > Freedom is indeed what distinguishes man from animals and plants. (location: 704)


  - > The Good News is that God in Christ has freed us; we need no longer be enslaved by alien forces. The battle was fought and won on Good Friday and the triumph was revealed to men at Easter. (location: 717)


  - > According to the New Testament, these powers can get hold of a man's total being and can control his life to such a degree that he is incapable of distinguishing himself from the alien power. This seems to be what has happened to white racism in America. It is a part of the spirit (location: 726)


  - > Unrestricted freedom is a form of slavery. (location: 734)


  - > A life of freedom is not the easy or happy way of life. That is why Sartre says man "is condemned to freedom." (location: 743)


  - > To be free in Christ means that man is stripped of the law as a guarantee of salvation and is placed in a free, mature love-relationship with God and man, which is man's destiny and in which Christ is the pioneer. (location: 747)


  - > It is significant to note the condition of the people to whom God chose to reveal his righteousness. God elected to be the Helper and Saviour to people oppressed and powerless in contrast to the proud and mighty nations. It is also equally important to notice that within Israel, his righteousness is on behalf of the poor, defenseless, and unwanted. "If God is going to see righteousness established in the land, he himself must be particularly active as `the helper of the fatherless' (location: 780)


  - > against the lofty and on behalf of the lowly; against those who already enjoy right and privilege and on behalf of those who are denied it and deprived of it." (location: 786)


  - > The rich, the secure, the suburbanite can have no part of God's righteousness because of their trust and dependence on the things of this world. (location: 794)


  - > His righteousness is reserved for those who come empty-handed, without any economic, political, or social power. That is why the prophets and Jesus were so critical of the economically secure. (location: 795)


  - > No Christian can evade this responsibility. He cannot say that the poor are in poverty because they will not work, or they suffer because they are lazy. Having come before God as nothing and being received by him into his Kingdom through grace, the Christian should know that he has been made righteous (location: 816)


  - > Indeed, I have even suggested that if Christ is present among the oppressed, as he promised, he must be working through the activity of Black Power. This alone is my thesis. How then is it possible to reconcile Black Power, and its emphasis on emancipation at all costs, with Christ's message of love? (location: 842)


  - > God's love is creative because "God does not love that which is already worthy of love, but on the contrary, that which in itself has no worth acquires worth just by becoming the object of God's love." 30 (location: 866)


  - > "Agape does not recognize value, but creates it. Agape loves and imparts value by loving. The man who is loved by God has no value in himself; what gives him value is precisely the fact that God loves him."31 (location: 870)


  - > Love prevents righteousness from being legalistic, and righteousness keeps love from being sentimental. (location: 878)


  - > It is this radical identification with the neighbor which prevents God's grace from becoming "cheap grace"34 and the mistaking of worship for faith. (location: 893)


  - > He now knows that the definition of himself defined by white society is inconsistent with the newly found image disclosed in Christ. In a world which has taught blacks to hate themselves, the new black man does not transcend blackness, but accepts it, loves it as a gift of the Creator. For he knows that until he accepts himself as a being of God in all of its physical blackness, he can love neither God nor neighbor. This may be what one Black Power advocate meant when he said : "Until blacks develop themselves, they can do nothing for humanity." (location: 905)


  - > They must say to whites that authentic love is not "help," not giving Christmas baskets but working for political, social, and economic justice, which always means a redistribution of power. It is a kind of power which enables the blacks to fight their own battles and thus keep their dignity. "Powerlessness breeds a race of beggars."46 (location: 937)


  - > The black man's response to God's act in Christ must be different from the white's because his life experiences are different. (location: 942)


  - > Thus, the love of self and the love of neighbor, which constitute the heart of one's being in God, never escape the possibility of self-annihilation and destruction of the neighbor. The violence in the cities, which appears to contradict Christian love, is nothing but the black man's attempt to say Yes to his being as defined by God in a world that would make his being into nonbeing. If the riots are the black man's courage to say Yes to himself as a creature of God, and if in affirming self he affirms Yes to the neighbor, then violence may be the black man's expression, sometimes the only possible expression, of Christian love to the white oppressor. (location: 947)


  - > But there is an ugly contrast between the sweet, nonviolent language of white Christians and their participation in a violently unjust system. Maybe the oppressor's being is so warped by his own view of himself that -every analysis made by him merely reveals his own inflated self-evaluation. (location: 954)


  - > What whites really want is for the black man to respond with that method which -best preserves white racism. All this suggests that white judgments about Christian love related to Black Power are as suspect as their other judgments relative to black America. (location: 963)


  - > With the death and resurrection of Christ, the gift of the Spirit to persons—rare in the Old Testament—becomes a possibility for all who respond to God's act in Christ in faithful obedience. (location: 980)


  - > The mistake of the modern church is to identify the work of God's Spirit in the believer either with private moments of ecstasy or with individual purification from sin, particularly from a short list of ritual pollutants, such as alcohol and tobacco. (location: 982)


  - > The man possessed by God's Spirit has no time to ask abstract questions about how the poor got to be poor or why blacks are hated by whites. (location: 989)

  - > I am unwilling to act like I have all the answers just to preserve your perception of my celebrity. (location: 228)


  - > In it Dr. Bessel van der Kolk writes about this reality, saying, “The essence of trauma is that it is overwhelming, unbelievable, and unbearable.” (location: 251)


  - > Christians have a disturbing habit of minimizing pain and making it seem less important than other concerns we should be focusing on. (location: 284)


  - > When the depression was at its height, I would drink incessantly, not even worrying about what the consequences would be. (location: 302)


  - > But most of us regularly fail to acknowledge the third source of chaos: the sins of others. (location: 311)


  - > Why would I want to sabotage my reality? As a “self-made” man, I had to come to grips with how the sins of others had created decades of trauma that placed me on the pathway to chaos. (location: 315)


  - > Growing up, if you experienced sexual assault, that was seen as a joke for our “boys,” (location: 337)


  - > When you are exposed to sexuality that early without healthy categories, trauma is free to run your life. (location: 347)


  - > Most people can’t comprehend how significant it is when survivors, especially Black men, share their stories. (location: 353)


  - > When speaking with survivors, most people focus on the action of abuse but not on how we should live with the pain and shame. People who are unaffected by abuse have never had to think about having to function at a high level even while they’re hurting or triggered. (location: 362)


  - > But then he showed up with a video game system and some weak words of apology. My mom asked me if he could come back. What was I supposed to say to that? (location: 396)


  - > “Traumatized people chronically feel unsafe inside their bodies: The past is alive in the form of gnawing interior discomfort. Their bodies are constantly bombarded by visceral warning signs, and, in an attempt to control these processes, they often become expert at ignoring their gut feelings and in numbing awareness of what is played out inside. They learn to hide from their selves.”4 (location: 436)


  - > Christians are not taught to value the specialists in the church, those people who are gifted in other disciplines outside of theology. (location: 453)


  - > Through my journey to restoration I’ve learned this simple truth: we can face our past willingly, or our lives will force us to face it. It’s really that simple. (location: 478)


  - > The past few years have taught me that I’m addicted to working my way out of my problems. I am driven by willpower, by the need to muscle myself out of my dysfunctional patterns. (location: 496)


  - > Instead, they were a furious introduction to street life. I saw a side of my uncles that made me feel appreciative of their presence and terrified all at the same time. (location: 509)


  - > But I knew this wasn’t just for them. I was being trained. After all, my perception was that the men in my family were tough, and I felt weak. (location: 515)


  - > Every one of them seemed to challenge my manhood. But no one had helped me to find it. (location: 525)


  - > I bobbed my head when the radio played a song I liked, and I dissected the intricacies because I thought music was beautiful—which, of course, meant I was soft, less of a man. (location: 526)
    I never realized he might have felt like this, too

  - > When I had guns pulled on me, I never responded like a gangster. I never displayed mythical, movie-character courage. I always backed down or ran away. Maybe I’m just not a man, I thought. (location: 534)


  - > It’s the favorite conservative talking point. “The real problem with the Black community is a lack of fathers,” they say. Commentators and pundits rail as they share statistics about a lack of biological fathers’ influence in the lives of their children. (location: 554)


  - > Systemic dysfunction is in our communities because systemic evil has been visited upon us. Dr. Joy DeGruy describes this as “post-traumatic slave syndrome,” a feeling that causes us to internalize the trauma of those who came before.1 (location: 559)


  - > I can track this legacy through my own family of origin. My great-great-grandmother Emilene was a slave who was brought over from West Africa when she was nine years old. (location: 566)


  - > But ironically, there are no specific rules in Scripture for being a king. (location: 642)


  - > For years I was convinced there was a “man script” for every contour of my behavior, and God had to show me there are all types of men in his kingdom, living different but faithful lives. There is no complicated script. (location: 648)


  - > But few of us are prepared for church dysfunction. (location: 663)


  - > I’ve realized that depending on what tribe we have committed to, we may or may not be familiar with these historical events and the theology that created them. I’m learning that much of our understanding of God is shaped by whose version of Christianity we find most appealing. (location: 678)


  - > In contrast, I never found the organized institution of church appealing. I didn’t understand why people would dress up in fancy clothes every week just to go to the church and pretend they weren’t messed up. (location: 694)


  - > After experiencing the love and care I saw my grandma give others around her who were less fortunate, traditional church had little appeal. (location: 697)


  - > Many people I’ve talked to have expressed their awkwardness as they came to God and tried to interact with a church tradition they did not understand. (location: 710)


  - > I didn’t realize that I had been saved not just into Christianity but into a conservative expression of the faith. (location: 712)


  - > Eventually the tribe I found myself attracted to was obsessed with theological accuracy, so eventually many of my Black Christian friends and I left the predominately Black Christian spaces in favor of places that were “more solid,” another word we often use to describe white conservative Christian spaces. (location: 726)


  - > What amazed me was that I couldn’t “turn it off.” It didn’t matter if the preacher was on television, was in my church, or was even someone I knew, the overarching question I would ask was the same: “Is this biblical?” (location: 739)


  - > Without a father in my life, I was pleased to be affirmed by any man, whichever one would applaud me the loudest. (location: 758)


  - > They weren’t looking to glean from the perspective of Black thinkers, the Black community, or even the Black church. They just wanted me to be an echo chamber for their point of view. To take it a step further, they wanted me to act as a correcting agent for my people. I was sent to rebuke the “slaves in the field” or the streets or the ghetto, and to admonish the prosperity preachers. (location: 774)


  - > I was being waved around as evidence that God could redeem from the inferior Black Christian community and truly transform even a hip-hop artist. (location: 778)


  - > The one who would resurrect hip-hop—without the filth—for God’s glory and their children’s safe entertainment. (location: 788)


  - > We look at American culture as “normal” and everything else is strange or foreign. Sadly, most people who believe they are appreciating a person of color and their culture are actually appropriating them. (location: 794)
    I do this often. Is the difference engagement with the community?

  - > strict sacred-secular divide. On one side is redeemed music that is explicitly Christian in all its content. On the other side is evil secular music that corrupts the souls of those who listen to it. The two are declared to be polar opposites, but I never understood the distinction. God can speak through any artist or creative, right? (location: 812)


  - > My Church Clothes project was the first time I shifted away from performing music considered strictly Christian, and acceptance of my music by my former audience quickly diminished. From that point on, I wasn’t trying to be the old Lecrae who incorporated the Puritans into every song. I wanted to be the artist whom a young Black man could identify with in his situation, whatever it was. (location: 821)


  - > I began to see subtle double standards in the music business. It would be okay for a CCM artist to post a picture with a country music star, or even appear alongside them at an event. (location: 834)
    Damn hadn’t thought of that.

  - > Just as deconstruction was needed to repair the wall, deconstruction of my faith to ground zero was what I needed to reestablish my faith. (location: 854)
    Same! Though somewhere along the line I got stuck.

  - > As I began to reconstruct my theology, I realized that I hadn’t read broadly enough. I realized that my circle of influence or frame of reference had been far too constricting and limiting. (location: 858)


  - >  (location: 860)
    Maybe this is the first step for me.

  - > So much of my life has been spent meeting the cultural expectations of other Christians based on minor biblical teachings rather than on the major commands of loving God and others. (location: 865)


  - > I wasn’t devoted to God. I was devoted to my devotion to God. (location: 868)


  - > Dr. King, Malcolm X, John Lewis, Diane Nash, and so many others strategically applied pressure when the cameras were on and reporters were present. They baited the police officers into pulling out their most violent discrimination so the American public could witness their brutality. They had a plan, a strategy to advance the movement. Those who attended this protest didn’t seem interested in any talk of strategy. (location: 907)


  - > Black men rarely had the opportunity to go hunting, and whenever we did we definitely never had the privilege of access to private game ranches. How much money did this cost? What type of privilege gave you access to this level of life? The wealth and luxury were completely foreign to me. I appreciated that. (location: 970)


  - > I was still under the impression that if I just explained it to my audience using facts and statistics, they would understand and at least respect my point of view. (location: 1012)


  - > Even the most clear-cut cases of injustice were microanalyzed to provide any justification for murdering an unarmed Black person. (location: 1019)


  - > We’ve spent years trying to figure out how to overcome our trauma, and at every turn our people are stigmatized and told that the problems we face are the fault of our own culture. To some white people, (location: 1025)


  - > I never wanted to be a puppet, never wanted to be used by others as a tool for their agenda. But that’s exactly what happened. I had been used for so long, I didn’t know how to establish agency for myself. (location: 1044)


  - > Women, people of color, global voices, and marginalized people groups all have something to teach us about their perspective on who Jesus is in their context. (location: 1050)


  - > I discovered Dr. Carl Ellis, Dr. Cornel West, Dr. Chanequa Walker-Barnes, Dr. James Cone, and many others. Though each of them had different styles and approaches, their scholarship helped to shape the lens that I used to read the Word of God. In my own personal life, I listen to the words of Michelle Higgins, Ekemini Uwan, and Dr. Christina Edmondson of Truth’s Table and had endless discussions with mentors like Léonce Crump and Dr. Eric Mason. (location: 1055)


  - > I recognize that American racism is not central to biblical theology. It’s a part of history but not ultimately history’s centerpiece. Racism existed in biblical times, and it’s evil, but it’s not bigger than death, which Jesus defeated. (location: 1078)


  - > They pointed to his stances on a few select issues as proof that he wasn’t God’s candidate, or worse, that he was a liar and a deceiver. (location: 1109)


  - > The people who didn’t want Black people to talk about politics suddenly felt free to advocate on behalf of this candidate and his movement. (location: 1127)


  - > the past is appealing to people of color? (location: 1136)
    The assumption that the past was better goes against the story of progress... Never noticed the contradiction.

  - > I was confronted with the reality that I was going to be performing as a tattooed Black man in front of people who supported Donald Trump. (location: 1142)


  - > I’m learning that it’s impossible to explain things to people who are committed to misunderstanding you. Much like saying, “Black lives matter,” the discussion around Kaepernick was frustrating because it turned into a battle of semantics. (location: 1176)


  - > Despite making videos about my own personal history with abortion, I always sympathized with the women who had to make impossible choices about their babies and the quality of life they would be born into. Do I agree with terminating a life? If you blanket it like that, of course not. But if a mother is on her deathbed and the doctors pose the choice of the baby’s life or her life, does she have an option? Can she choose to save her own life and still be in good moral standing? Is she condemned? Better yet, what would you do? Does your theology have a category for that? (location: 1194)


  - > Political privilege is the ability not to care about certain issues because they don’t directly affect you or because you don’t have categories to explain them. (location: 1234)


  - > The Christian music industry subculture is run by conservative Christians. (location: 1245)


  - > To them, to speak about anything that relates to race and current events is being partisan and biased. I don’t think speaking about the value of Black life is partisan. I’m just tired of Black bodies lying dead in the streets. I don’t think speaking in lament of gun violence is taking a partisan stance. (location: 1259)


  - > “Don’t let the hypocrisy of one group lead you to embrace the hypocrisy of their counterparts.” (location: 1269)
    Will and apocolypse never taught me this

  - > I felt spiritually homeless. I ran from even talking about church or related terminology because it brought up so many painful wounds and betrayals. (location: 1284)
    I relate so deeply to this.

  - > I didn’t believe in God anymore. Or at least I felt like I didn’t believe in him. I know, Christian artists are supposed to have faith that moves mountains. We are never supposed to have cracks in our armor. We aren’t supposed to show any spiritual weaknesses. I never imagined I could ever be that far gone, but that’s the way chaos works. (location: 1289)


  - > Many Christians would tell you that mental illness is something that can be overcome with theology or just by praying the right prayer. (location: 1308)


  - > I’m speaking broadly, but the road of discipleship is littered with broken souls, ripped apart by their fear to face depression with compassionate hearts. (location: 1313)


  - > I would sit in front of the television and watch a season of a sitcom and never crack a smile, never chuckle, never respond. At first I kept up the appearance of normalcy for my kids. (location: 1320)


  - > We want every bit of the success without any of the emptiness. (location: 1335)


  - > They just want to feel alive. I learned the hard way that you can’t sin your way out of suffering. In the end you just create more suffering from your sin. (location: 1381)


  - > I threw out some prayers and read a few Scriptures occasionally, but my faith was nothing like when I first started following Jesus. (location: 1391)
    Same. exactly the same.

  - > there was no telling if that was really God or the conditioning of my religious group. (location: 1398)


  - > Growing up, I never felt free enough to express myself, especially my emotions. That’s actually what led me to write poetry and songs. (location: 1431)


  - > Most of us don’t know that we’re coping. We can’t recognize that our obsessive behaviors are actually addictions that empower us to avoid our deeper issues. Then we ignore how serious they are to justify ourselves. (location: 1437)


  - > You know how to follow rules but not how to pay attention to your inner self. (location: 1460)


  - > to be a celebrity and person of interest who was constantly attacked by online trolls? What would it look like not to be cornered about everything I did by people who claimed to be Christians? Wouldn’t it be freeing to escape the daily pressures of family, record labels, all the responsibilities that brought me pain? What would it look like to leave everything behind? (location: 1483)


  - > I was so disoriented by the pain that I thought about leaving my wife. We hadn’t been on the same page for a while. She didn’t understand what I was dealing with, and her patience was wearing thin. (location: 1520)


  - > bad.” I’m learning that whenever you say something in your life is not “that bad,” you’re on the path to self-destruction. (location: 1537)


  - > This was the worst possible time to travel to Egypt. The country was in the middle of political unrest, making any travel into the area dangerous and potentially deadly. (location: 1556)


  - > I was floored by the tour presentation. It was faithful to Jesus in a way that felt authentic, truly human. I never would have known about the books and materials they cited if I had stayed in the West. (location: 1575)


  - > “This one—we don’t know his name—but he’s regarded as one of the worst pharaohs in this line.” Curious, I asked, “Well, why is that?” She said, “Because he lost all the slaves.” “What?” She continued, “Well, they say that he was in possession of thousands of slaves. He was using them to build things, and he lost them all. They all escaped.” Instinctively, I said, “Oh, you mean the ones who were freed by Moses, right?” (location: 1591)


  - > My desire for intellectual reasoning caused me to have moments of doubt and uncertainty. So, how fascinating that God used my personality to start the process of reviving my soul. (location: 1604)


  - > friends. I had actually torn down my previous systems of accountability that had been constructed to protect me. (location: 1611)


  - > I went back to constructing the same self-righteous structures that defined my early walk with God. (location: 1626)


  - > Eager to prove that I was “back,” I reinstituted family devotionals and clung to the typical ways of teaching my family unit how to be spiritual. My family will turn around because I’m going to make sure they do. My label will be fired up again because I’m back to my normal self. (location: 1632)


  - > But the motives of my heart were self-righteous. I was taking every opportunity to prove myself to others, and worse, to prove myself to God. I wanted to show that I was “back on the right track.” And this led me to a startling realization. (location: 1639)


  - > Whenever my devotion to Jesus was consistent, everything was fine. When my devotion failed, I felt like a failure. Whenever my actions were consistent with my beliefs, I was empowered. But that couldn’t last. My self-righteousness could take me only so far. Without grace, I would only continue to stumble in pursuit of personal health. (location: 1647)

## Reflection
- I found this book stunning because it was written in the 90's and was concerned about #Gun #Violence then... It's gotten so so much worse. I struggled with this book because it was so out of date and I wasn't sure which laws were still out dated and on the books. Nonetheless, it was shocking to see just how little regulation exists in the gun industry. 

## Ideas
-[[202103282113 - Freedom entails responsibility]]
	- I find it fascinating in the conversation about guns and vaccines the total disconnect between freedom and responsibility. 
		- Gun distributors are less liable than gun owners. Gun makers face no liability
		- There are no safety regulations around guns (like you know, toys and other consumer products)
		- Because of the neglect of this idea, we are now in a situation where we have over 600 million guns out there. Gun control is not going to fix this. It's not that simple. It will help, but it won't solve the problem since there are so many guns already out there. 
- The NRA wasn't always like this
	- It started off as an association of hunters who were looking out for hunters rights. Then in the 1970's a hard line dude came in and changed everything. That said, the average NRA member doesn't hold the extreme views of the organization
- The 2nd amendment says "well regulated"
	- Never knew this and it fascinates me. What does that mean? Not 100% sure but I doubt it's all kinds of guns around. 
- Making gun companies liable for damages is a [[Nudge]] style intervention that would effectively regulate the industry
	- Fascinating point. Gotta wonder why this never happened. Toy manufacturers have to do this, why not for guns? 
- The human toll of guns is high and data is bad
	- Data for injuries isn't collected, which makes it seem better than it is. 
- There are safety features that would make guns safer
	- A simple thing is making sure that bullets don't stay in the gun when you pull out the clip. As it stands, they do. Which gives you the false impression that it is unloaded. 


## Connections
- The whole book reminded me of [[202103131649 - Laws can be used violently by the majority or those in power]] except in this case the absence of laws do #Violence. 
- [[03132021 - The gospel of enterprise has been used for centuries to demean outsiders]] and [[03132021 - People with capital use dreams of prosperity to inspire others to take risks]] and [[202103131919 - Christianity and capitalism are deeply intertwined]] blow up badly here. The [[202103302314 - Humans are not wholly good or bad]] complicates things further. Basically gun sellers can say they are simply doing good #Capitalism and helping "hard workers" who can afford to buy guns and dodge any culpability. Meanwhile folks who make money of this shit are pulling the strings from above and can dodge #Responsibility as well. 
- The #NRA has done an excellent job recognizing [[03-03-2021 - Our language creates our reality]] and fuzzying the fact that [[03-03-2021 - Language can be violent]].

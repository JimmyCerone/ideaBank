A book about #Love.

## Reflections
- Mating in Captivity feels as significant as [[Black Swan by Nassim Taleb]] or [[Reboot by Jerry Colonna]]. Totally redid the way I view my relationship with [[Liv Panozzo]]. A few key takeways:
	- Eroticism and Intimacy are different (and require different things)
		- Intimacy is about security and stability while eroticism is about mystery and otherness
			- There is always tension here. Key to eroticism is recognition of otherness in your partner because that creates mystery. If you merge, you have great intimacy but lose eroticism because you aren't separate.
	- There is always a 3rd wheel
		- I struggled with this one at first but found it interesting. Her point is that there is always a third in the relationship. Some welcome the third (swingers), some allow it in fantasy, and other ignore it. Talking about the third and setting good boundaries is best practice. 
	- Fantasy is a part of play and eroticism. 
		- Fantasy doesn't correspond to reality. It's more like dreams, which have meaning that is non-obvious. 
		- Connected here is the idea that #Play, well done, can play with hierarchies. Fantasy can help us heal from the injuries of hierarchy and power by letting us mess with them in a safe place (think BDSM)
		- All this also runs against Puritan ideas, which advocate clear goals, hard work, and moderation. Play is inefficient, undefined, and exuberant. The US and it's puritan ideals struggle with this. 
	- Children have taken a central role in the family
		- Perelle points out an interesting change in society where children have shifted to the center of the family, which is not necessarily good for them. If you aren't careful, they can take the place of your partner. 
	- Verbal Communication is overrated
		- Another salient point is that nonverbal communication is critical and not everything can be explained. This fact hit me very hard and is something I hope to use to shift Liv and I's relationship.  
		- The desire to know everything can become prying as well, which is a habit of mine I want to cut out. It's seen as positive, a way of better knowing your partner, but it's really invasive. 


## Connections
- This book had interesting connections to [[Love's Executioner]], in some cases taking an opposing stance. Esther Perelle advocated for some secrets in a relationship as they are part of #Privacy and can often cause more harm than good. She notes it is uniquely American to try to be direct and honest all the time. Dr. Yalom was more on the American side of things, frequently advocating for total openness. 
	- Her advice here runs directly contrary to [[Radical Honesty]], which I didn't like and now like even less. Seems a stupid approach. I think Perelle's is much more useful. Radical honesty smacks of dogma.

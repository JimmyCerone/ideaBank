A book about the slight of hand of the #King of Belgium in the 1800's who made everyone think he was a #Philanthropy while he was really just plundering the Congo. 

## Reflections
- Had a similar effect as [[The Elephant and the Dragon by Robyn Meredith]] had on me. I know so little of world #History and have such a limited understanding of other #Cultures . I had little to no understanding of what #Colonialism was and its effects on the #Economics of #Europe and #America. It was much worse than I thought. Much of the #Wealth in these countries was literally stolen. 
- The end of the book was particularly depressing because you realize that the Congo wasn't much worse than any other colony. It just got more publicity. Atrocities like it happened all over the world and in #Africa. Makes me very angry that people dare question why other countries or people are worse off. It's pretty damn obvious and it's not about fucking #WorkEthic.
- Weird Epstein vibes from King Leopold. Makes me wonder how widespread pedophilia is among the rich and famous and how that has changed across time. Were people always this grody? 
- What's weird about this book is Leopold's lack of virtiol. He wasn't like James Earl Ray from [[Hellbound on His Trail by Hampton Sides]]... He didn't seem to hate people, he just didn't see them at all, which is scarier. The Congo was an #Economics issue for him and people never entered the equations. 
- Leopold was a user. He deeply understood people and used that understanding to manipulate them. He did it with the explorers, the newspapers as they smeared him, and many US senators. He even ensnared John D. Rockefeller Jr's father in law in it all, the one connection to [[Titan The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.]], though I'm sure a lot of #Money came to the Rockefeller's through the Congo.
	- On another note, I didn't realize how international #Business was even at this time. Also makes me wonder how much of the Gilded Age #Money was from the Congo and Africa. 

## Facts
- The Kingdom of the Kongo was roughly 300 hundred square miles. It's capital was Mbanza Kongo. Existed in 1491
	- Time was marked by the lunar month and there were four day weeks (with the first day a holiday)
	- King collected taxes and maintained a currency 
	- Slavery existed, which was more benign than European slavery but also meant the Europeans could tap an existing market, something with disastrous consequences later. 
- Workhouses existed in Europe in the 1840's
- Belgium was ruled by Holland until 1830
- In the 1860's Napoleon tried to create a #French run #Mexico
- The Congo River is HUGE
- The turning point for the colony was the US's recognition of the Congo. Bad stuff.
- King Leopold pulled everything off by claiming he would support a central tenet of #Capitalism and grant #FreeTrade and a free #Market in the Congo. While this helped gather people to his cause, it was also part of it's fall (surprisingly the #Dehumanizing of people didn't quite do the trick)
- There was a strong movement in #America to send #Slave s back to #Africa. This continued into the 1960's as seen in [[Hellbound on His Trail by Hampton Sides]]. There was also the opposite instinct, to take over #Africa for #Americans and #Europeans as seen in Hellbound and Rhodesia. 
- Slavery was legal in #Turkey until almost the 1900s. 
- #Britain held #Egypt
- Many Civil War veterans fought for the Republic of Mexico, which was fighting against #France's rule there. 
- Cartoons have been used forever to poke fun at those in #Power and raise awareness. 
- Prolonged mutiny in 1897 is reminiscent of [[The Heart of Everything That Is]]. Ultimately unsuccessful but impressive and bold. 
	- Would return in force in the 1960's for rebellions against #Colonialism that would eventually lead to the granting of #Independence and new #Government 
- The Congo was the inspiration for the #Fiction book Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad. 
	- The book is still read now, though it's inspiration is rarely discussed. Now it is referred to as a work of pure fiction and the themes are thought to be largely symbolic
	- In an odd twist, the author, while critical of #Imperialism and #Colonialism elsewhere, was supportive of #Britain 's claims. 
- The Reverend William Sheppard was one of the few missionaries to understand and empathize with the #Indigenous people, even learning their #Language. 
	> I grew very fond of the Bakuba. They were the finest looking race I had seen in Africa, dignified, graceful, courageous, honest, with an open smiling countenance and really hospitable. Their knowledge of weaving, embroidery, wood carving, and smelting was the highest in equatorial Africa.
- The #System of quotas used in the Congo was later exported to the Soviet Gulags. 
- Leopold, like many weird paranoid old dudes, became a #Hypocondriac in his old age.
- Morel was a company man who ended up being the one to fight the longest and hardest against the Congo. He noticed that materials of #War were leaving #Belgium for the Congo and #Rubber was coming back. No #Money was being exchanged. 
	- Discovered that Leopold was skimming the #Profit of the colony... 
	- Deduced the existence of #Slave s from the huge profits, a big jump and an accurate one. 
	- Reminded me so much of Ida Tarbell from [[Titan The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.]]. 
	- One of the only people in the whole book to have a happy #Marriage 
- One of the Congo's most stringent critiques was Roger Casement, who was #Gay, which later lead to his death (which is insane. Oscar Wild was sentenced to 2 years of hard labor for the same "crime")
	- Chose to keep a journal, which is how it was discovered that he was gay
	- Was a #British consul to the Congo.
	- Became a close friend of Morel and helped publish #Newspapers that would expose what happened in the Congo.  



## Connections
- [[Hellbound on His Trail by Hampton Sides]] made weird connections with this book. The killer of Martin Luther King Junior tried to flee to Rhodesia and even tried to join the army that Leopold built as a mercenary to escape from his crimes. 
- There was a distinct lack of connection with [[The Wright Brothers by David]], which was weird. They were active in Europe around the time and I wonder if they knew about what was going on and if they had any comment. Unlike the Rockefeller's, their hands were not likely dirty as they had less #Finance interests overall. 
- Connects deeply with my writing [[The Destructive Force that is Exploration]]. The exploration by Stanley in the early days was all measurement and destruction. 


## Questions
- How many serial killers went unnoticed? How widespread was exporting #Criminals to colonies? 
- How were US railroad fortunes and robber barons tied up in this?
- How many of these systems are still in place today? 
- Why did the US assassinate their first leader? How often did this happen? 
	- What does an assassination do? How do they set leadership back? Is there any way to model what would have happened otherwise?
- Why wasn't Africa inhabited like the America's? 
- Was exploring Africa the bitcoin of then? 
- What atrocities are happening today? What can be done to stop them?
	- It was kind of depressing to see how much work went into raising awareness in the Congo for very little to change. Very little has change even now, almost 100 years later. 
- How much history from this time period is preserved by indigenous people? Where do these sources live? In books, in people? 
- How much were missionaries complicit in the events?
- How much #History is trapped in #Fiction that no one believes?
- Was anyone in the Congo ever punished? Were any colonialists ever punished anywhere? 
- Did railroad construction in the US have a high death toll as well? 
- An oblique reference was made to the oppression of Bulgarians and Armenians. What happened to them? 
	- Turkish massacred the Bulgarians in 1876 and the Armenians in 1890s

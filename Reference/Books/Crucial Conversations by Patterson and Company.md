## Reflections
- I think this book conflates vulnerability and intimacy with good conversations. They are related, but not as closely as the authors hope. I've heard that more emotionally open oil rigging teams are safer (maybe in [[Range]]?). The real component is #Intimacy, which as pointed out in [[Mating in Captivity by Esther Perelle]], is not always verbal. 
- Spooked a bit by the fact I spotted [[03132021 - The gospel of enterprise has been used for centuries to demean outsiders]] here. The dreaded quote, "Perfect practice makes perfect"

## Ideas
- [[03062021 - Levers]] that create a crucial conversation
	1. Opinions vary
	2. Stakes are high
	3. Emotions Run Strong
	    - This doesnt' feel independent of stakes are high and opinions vary. 
	- This is a great #Heuristics for identifying a tough conversation, which can help you prepare for it. 
- We avoid crucial #Conversation when the #Risk is too high. Risk is everywhere! Yet we seem to have no handle on it!

- More [[03062021 - Levers]]... There are 3 outcomes to a [[032920212323 - Crucial Conversation]]: 
	1. We avoid them 
	2. We face them and it ends poorly (likely because we freeze - [[Waking the Tiger]])
	3. We face them and they go well

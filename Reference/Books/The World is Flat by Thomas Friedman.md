## Reflections
- Almost read this book a few times as it was an old Pop book. After hearing a critique of it in [[What We Can learn from a Big Boat Stuck in a Canal]] related to [[202103291034 - Efficiency is not efficient]], I'm still interested in reading it but will be more critical. I'm guessing that [[Cheap - The High Cost of Discount Culture]] would disagree with it and [[The Elephant and the Dragon by Robyn Meredith]] would be sympathetic. 
- I'd be very curious to hear what Pop's thoughts were on this topic (I suspect they'd be positive). What did Duff & Phelps believe? 

## Ideas 
- Take the fat out of the system at every point
	- Probably connected to [[202103291111 - The shareholder is everything]] from Milton Friedman. 
	- The #Idea is that by viewing everything component as disconnected, like the industrial revolution encouraged, you can optimize each part. It's like the industrial revolution applied to white collar work except that the parts are not independent. They are interdependent, which blows up this whole theory. #Assumptions

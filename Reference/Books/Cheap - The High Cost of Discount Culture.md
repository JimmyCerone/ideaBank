## Thesis Statement of the Book:

- To improve our world, we have to return to concreteness and specificity. Capitalism makes all capital interchangeable - people, animals, buildings. The author argues for #Frugalism - which is getting things at a good value (not just getting them cheap). Further, frugalism cares about specific capital - that horse or this worker. Capital is not interchangeable to the frugalist, who is connected to it. 
- Further, to improve working conditions we need worldwide treaties and labors laws that are enforced. 

## Questions: 
- Why do lower prices in stores lead to increased prices in fixed cost areas like housing and health care?
- Where does craftsmanship play a role here? [[Shop Class as Soulcraft - An Inquiry into the Value of Work]]
- Why have costs in some areas gone up as others have gone down? 
- Why don't we focus on creating more high paying jobs? Why are we so stuck on cheap?
- Why didn't efforts to stop the creep of cheap work?
- How does globalism work here? Especially interesting is the chapter on #Food.
	- The Irish potato famine occurred even as Ireland exported tons of food. There just was no cheap food.
- Why don't more, cheaper goods make our lives better?


## Ideas:

- Shifting of cost to the consumer
	- #Stores used to have sales clerks that helped you find stuff. With the advent of Walmart style shops, they changed the store layout to make it self serve, eliminating the need for help. 
		- #Innovation here were the shopping cart and the checkout line
	- IKEA offloads the cost of assembling their furniture to you. They also make you come to them by limiting the number of their stores
- Low food costs result in food insecurity because people store less (just in time food), deincentives farming (which hurts you when there is less one year), and makes price increases hurt waaay more.\
- Factory #Food tastes different than wild food.
- Cheap food made a big difference when food was 50% of our costs, but now that it's so much cheaper, the benefits of further cheapness can be bad and bring marginal benefits
- "Creative Destruction"
	- Assumes that destroying working class jobs in the US (Like manufacturing), will creative new jobs in new industries
		- Doesn't quite hold up, in part because America doesn't have a monopoly on entrepreneurship and innovation and in part because not everyone in America wants to be creative all the time
- Low costs hurt innovation
	- if there is no profit margin and price is the only differentiator (with low barrier to entry), then there is no profit left to drive innovation
	- Weird because the same innovations in logistics that made low costs possible further prevent innovation by killing profit margins
- #Economics health is tied to wages
	- Cutting wages cuts spending which hurts the economy
- #Quality and value are not opposing
	- We assume price = good quality, but you can have good prices with good quality
- #Price is a single metric that we use as a proxy for value, sustainability, and many other things. The compression of a complicated thing into a single metric is a huge part of the problem
- Labor and market and capital used to be colocated and social pressure enforced ethical standards. Now with these separated, there is no oversight for consumers (like there was in the US in the 1900's labor strikes) and little enforcement so we end up with a race to the bottom and horrible working conditions.


## Quotes:

"In the age of cheap we are all tourists"


## My Reflections
- If you can't pay your workers a living wage then your business is not #Sustainable.

This book made me realize that everything is so fucking complicated. #Globalism isn't going away and it's not a positive or a negative, but both. The solutions aren't simple either. It's such a complicated system, I guess that's my takeaway. 

I was really struck by the authors point that while things have gotten cheaper, we aren't better off. That's an odd paradox that bears thinking on.

This is like a bolt on to [[The Righteous Mind by Jonathon Haidt]] with more practical info. A great companion to [[The Power of Habits by Charles Duhigg]]. 

Remaking how I think about societal change. I can do it without money, which is a game changer. Makes me think...

The Key Ideas:
1. Direct the rider ([[202105051423 - What looks like resistance is often a lack of clarity]])
	1. Follow bright spots
	2. Create a post card destination
	3. Script the moves
2. Motivate the elephant ([[202105051319 - What looks like laziness is often exhaustion]])
3. Shape the path ([[202105051426 - What looks like a people problem is often a situation problem]])

All those ideas double as [[03062021 - Levers]] for change. To create change you can: 
- Add clarity (direct the rider)
- Boost motivation (motivate the elephant)
- Make the journey easier (shape the path)

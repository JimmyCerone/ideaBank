This is like a bolt on to [[The Righteous Mind by Jonathon Haidt]] with more practical info. A great companion to [[The Power of Habits by Charles Duhigg]]. 

Remaking how I think about societal change. I can do it without money, which is a game changer. Makes me think...

The Key Ideas:
1. Direct the rider ([[202105051423 - What looks like resistance is often a lack of clarity]])
	1. Follow bright spots
	2. Create a post card destination
	3. Script the moves
		1. Action triggers help here to decrease decisions ([[Making decisions is hard]])
2. Motivate the elephant ([[202105051319 - What looks like laziness is often exhaustion]])
	1. Find the feeling
		1. Consider connecting your desired change to an existing identity or create one (inventors example in Brazil)
	2. Shrink the Change
		1. 2 out of 10 is better than 0 out of 8. Let people know what they're already doing.
	3. Grow Your People
		1. Growth mindset
		2. Encourage tiny wins ([[7 Principles of a Successful Marriage]])
3. Shape the path ([[202105051426 - What looks like a people problem is often a situation problem]])
	1. Tweak the environment (1 click ordering)
	2. Build Habits ([[The Power of Habits by Charles Duhigg]])
	3. Rally the Herd ([[202105061734 - Weak ties are strong social motivators]])

All those ideas double as [[03062021 - Levers]] for change. To create change you can: 
- Add clarity (direct the rider)
- Boost motivation (motivate the elephant)
- Make the journey easier (shape the path)

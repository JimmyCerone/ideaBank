#March #TwentyTwentyOne 

## Reflection
- Wild book - I learned so much about the FBI and Martin Luther King Jr. Fascinating look at the late 60's culture as well - crazy to consider George Wallace was running for President. I consider him a predecessor to Donald Trump. 
- This book blew up a lot of my mental models surrounding gun access, white supremacists (how open they are and were), Martin Luther King Jr and the prison system. Then there's the whole idea of the FBI and their political slant at the time. Just so much history I was unaware of and so much context that I lacked. 

## Facts
- MLKJ's murderer had previously escaped jail and went on to do it again after he killed MLKJ (though he didn't stay escaped for long)
- MLKJ supported UBI
	- Poor people's campaign was to occupy washington - whole city built up to do so
	- He had lost respect within the community and was considered old hat (rise of Black Power, Malcolm X and others)
	- Barely slept.
- The #FBI was created by and shaped by one man (J Edgar Hoover)
	- He ran the agency forever (through like 4 presidents) and brought both many of it's innovations and oversights. You can't understand the FBI without understanding him. 

## Connections
- Connects to [[Lethal Passage - The Story of a Gun by Erik Larson]] because there is no way James Earl Ray should have been able to acquire a gun. He did it like 5 days before he killed MLKJ and made weird comments throughout the purchase. If they'd had liability for the killing, the gun debate would be much different.

## The Great American Tap Rap

- Page 1: Started in tap at age 4 yet was later switched by her mother to modern - wouldn't think of tap again until she was 25 and saw it on the big screen with Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers

- Page 6: Combined her love of writing and dance after a trip to Greece and dug up the tap masters who had gone underground after the Great Tap Drought.

- Page 7: Began studying under Stanley brown then went to NYC to find more folks

 - Side note: Living situation was terrible.

- Page 9: "Where Gregory idolized Sammy Davis, Jr., I idolized Isadora Duncan. Gregory...defined tap in terms of the Challenge...being the best...I felt tap was a "sensibility". Gregory was commercial, practical, all about tap dancers making a living at tap. I was anti-commercial, performance art, left wing, romantic, (although I still wanted to make a living at it)."

- Page 14: First encounter with “Real” tappers in the business in 1974, met Chuck Green and more. Wanted to “get their feet”. 

- Page 16: With old school tappers, a lesson is a “session” - reminds me of Heather’s experience. Also, teaching was not done in the studio and Chuck Green didn’t know how to break his steps down. Led to her discovery that all tappers are historians. 

- Page 19: Bubbles pioneered dropping his heels, which changed the art form by adding sound and connecting it to jazz. 

- Page 20: Jazz was not old, but had gone underground. It was also old though, originating with slaves. 

- Page 21: Closed vs open hoofing. #Hoofing that “could sell” was open hoofing like Fred Astaire. 

- Page 25: Called Honi Coles every week for months to try to set up a time to work with him. This introduced her to the Copasetics.

- Page 29: The #Copasetics Ball was a real turning point, it introduced her to a whole new world of tap and helped her answer history questions that plagued her while introducing her to the people that made the history. 

- Page 31: 1949 group of entertainers commemorated Bill “Bojangles” Robinson by forming a group called the Copasetics, derived from the yiidish “copa Seder” which means everything is in order. 

- Page 34-35: A who’s who of the performance - so many legends.

## John Bubbles - Stage Father
### Page 93
- John Bubbles created a new style by dropping his heels, adding more #Syncopation, and putting #Tap into the #Jazz bracket. 
	- Source: Jazz Dance by Marshall and jean Stearns'
- Recurring theme of the Challenge came up: 
	> My whole life was based on that - the Challenge against the other fellow.

### Page 94
> I already knew how to turn so I walked into the Hoofers' Club and did my turn and was booed out. I went to California and when I came back, I was a dancer. I had everything. I went back to the club and ran everybody out. I practiced day and night under theaters, and backstage. 
	- The Hoofers' club was a room in Harlem that was for tap dancers - where you could dance all night long. Lots of folks got good here

### Page 95
> "Some people have complained that the song 'Shine' put the negro down," I said. "Did you think so?" I used the word "negro" instead of "black" because I had been reading Stearns. The Stearns had published their book in 1966, and had used the word "negro" to define African Americans. I also knew "negro" was the word Bubbles most identified with and he was extremely race conscious in all his conversations. "How could they put the negro down?" he responded impatiently. "the words to that song are beautiful."

### Page 96
- Taught Fred Astaire and slowed things down for him since his style was so hard to learn. His goal was to keep the audience clapping the whole damn time. 

### Page 97
- Became an advisor of sorts for her career, giving her hard earned praise and pointed critiques. 

### Page 99
- Late in life had a stroke and thus taught Jane how to tap using his hands on hers to show her the rhythms. 
- Revealed the tough side of showbiz, in the questioning your own worth outside of your craft.

## Ginger Rogers
### Page 103
- Learned to make up dances in the neighborhoods growing up. 
- Very tough interview, didn't like people asking certain questions and wouldn't reveal where and how she learned to #Dance, nor did she quite claim being a dancer (felt it was a part of showbiz that she had to learn, not the whole thing)

### Page 104
> Gamely I went on. I asked her about #Women in #Tap. "Women today are so liberated," she said. "They'd like to kick their sisters right in the rear and I don't think that's nice 'cause they'll go right out and vote for a man when there's a woman who could probably do the job just as well. See, the innate jealousy of the human mind is something you just can't cope with." She launched into a long rap about how companies screw women, and how women should be able to stand up for other women.  

### Page 105
- Had some interesting ideas about limiting beliefs and was very pragmatic about her craft and career. Also very focused on the now: 
	> "I don't compare. As Shakespeare said, 'Comparisons are odious.' You're asking me limited questions because your thoughts are limited and until you dispose of them, my girl, those thoughts aren't going to hurt me. They're going to hurt you. There's an old saying: 'The head that thinks it is the head that hurts.'"


## 140 - 225

### Hollywood and Trading Eights
- Participated in the movie _TAP_ with Gregory Hines, Sammy Davis Jr, and many hoofers in 1988 or so. 
	- Gregory Hines was in his volume phase where his main focus was to get LOUD. Utilized #Tap dancer Al Desio's invention combining tap and electronics, Tap-Tronics TM to bring his style to the film
	- The movie dealt with the debate raging among tappers of the day: Was Broadway tap or John Bubbles style tap the "real" style?
	- Tons of competition among #Dancers in the #Movie made it hard to be in. Lots of schadenfreude. 
	- Felt the movie was male biased:
		> While the "go" of the script was unchangeable and built around the men, the women's dancing was decorative and improvised from the get go. 
	- Beginning of the thread of CHALLENGES - the men on set were constantly involved in these. 
		- Called "trading eights", a true setup for competition and one upsman ship
		- The author's thoughts:
		> I totally hated that part of tap's tradition and found it to be arcane...To me, his plan reeked of machismo, competition for the sake of competition
	- The author became depressed through the course of the filming, in part because of the competition and in part because of the isolation and craziness of Hollywood


### Sammy Groupie
- Sammy Davis, Jr. was in _TAP_ - he of the Rat Pack, Vegas, and Mr. Showbiz. Was able to mix fame with deep roots in tap and connections to the OGs.
- Sammy was a tapper originally, but put down his shoes when tap went underground, trading it for showbiz. 
> When Sammy's character in _TAP_ talked about "the real thing," I knew he was referring to black dancers' contributions. 
> Race was often _the_ unspoken subject between black and white dancers when I was learning about tap. 

### A Cutting Session with Gregory Hines
>  Cutting Session: Jam session where people (men) try to outdo and out-impress one another
- Gregory Hines loved the Challenge and cutting sessions, while Jane hated them. Their debate was tied closely to their thoughts about the place of #Women in tap. Here's Gregory's thoughts:
	> I've noticed that tap is thought of by people in power situations as a black, male-dominated art. Tap has always had that paternal quality about it since Uncle BO and Shirley Temple. How people perceive it makes a difference in what happens. We men need to point our fingers at ourselves and get this happening. Ladies do more for. tap dancing now. White women have brought the thing back. Something new might come of it. Equilibrium of the races - it's all there in tap. 
- Hines seemed to be controversial in some aspects, encouraging women to dress up as a way to get more work. Jane disagreed, pushing back on his claims, saying that women weren't allowed to dictate what they wore on stage and if they could they'd do just fine. 

### Comparaholics Anonymous
> A desperation for work, mixed with ego and a yearning for some sort of security they never had, made some of them take any gig. When asked whether the floor mattered at one of our venues, Cookie Cook replied, "We'll work on rugs."
- This chapter is all about her troubles with the competitive nature of tap and the discomfort with declaring winners and losers. She wished tap were more about #Collaboration. She said, "Can't we all have a good time and get along?"
- As a side note, she talked about the importance of order in a line up. The biggest performance usually went second to last just before everyone leaves. 

### The Nicholas Brothers Get a Salad Bowl
- The Nik brothers worked with everyone - starting out as kids. They worked with Duke Ellington in Stormy Weather and even Cab Calloway!

### Stop-Time: New Tap, New Art Deco
- This chapter addresses the connections between #Art Deco in Miami and Tap. The author unsuccessfully tried to relocate her act to Miami, failing because people didn't like her #History filled humorous act. 
	- Both Art Deco and Tap were reviving movements started in the 1930's. 

![Miami's Art Deco District: sun, pastel shades and neon ...](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.friendlyrentals.com%2FFR_imgs%2Fblog%2FMiami-art-deco.jpg&f=1&nofb=1)](https://images.friendlyrentals.com/FR_imgs/blog/Miami-art-deco.jpg)

> Tap itself is perceived as a lower class (black) art, although some of its roots also seem to be costumed with top hats, white ties, and tails in gorgeous Deco settings. Low art, high art. Lastly, both Art Deco and tap have often been described as uplifting. I think a big part of hwy these revivals may have happened at the same time was that we were all looking not only for the genuine in art, but maybe even, some "fun" again. These revivals followed demoralizing times. 

### Miami Danny Rose
- This chapter talks about her failed attempt to bring her #Tap to Miami. The presenter who brought her in misjudged her fit with the audience. All her jokes bombed and her dreams of living out her days in Miami went with them. 

### Carry Your Shoes - Tap Dancing in India
- Jane received a Fulbright to explore the connections between Kathak from India (dance with bare feet) and #Tap. 
	> Colonel Rege told me about the temples and courts and Mogul empire where the kathaks danced and were married to God. Kathak means "storyteller" and when the dancers aren't telling their stories with their "abhinaya" or expressions, they slap their bare feet on the hard marble floors creating magical, unimaginable rhythms. Ankle bells are tied on each pair of feet to enhance the sound. 

- Met a mix of American expats and eager to host Indians with whom to share tap. 
	- Was featured at many hotels while in India to perform. 
	- A very lonely time as well, though productive in terms of dance and connections
	- In an interesting parallel, many of the old masters of Kathak were treated with disdain like old tap gurus. Were not treated with reverence and respect in their final years. 

### End of an Era - Buster Brown, A Real Class Act
- Buster Brown was one of the few that could dodge the #Rivalry and #Competition of #Tap. 
	- Loved kids. 
	- Inspired Gregory Hines, who preached a message of reconciliation at his fueral. 
	- Was a mentor to Heather Cornell and Max Pollak


### Savion Glover: Tap is Young Again
- Savion was the next generation. Mentored by many of the greats and started when he was 12 or so.
	- Focused on #History, called his work "Edutainment" because it both educated and entertained. 
	- Not competitive (nor was his whole generation) in the same way as Gregory Hines. 
		> It's not about being better than others. I try to keep my chops up, so I can just be. We need to be individuals first. We're strong. The public will see individualism and see how strong the dance is. 
	- Noise / Funk a production by him got so big it hit broadway
	- Danced in Happy Feet

### Stop-Time: The Drum is a Tap Dancer
- 20% tax on entertainment during world war II helped kill tax (and most public dancing)
- Attempted to trace the connection between tap and drums yet found it contested
	- Some acknowledged the connection (Philly Joe started in tap then became a great drummer and credited tap)
	- Others were more skeptical, like Buddy Rich, a drummer who said there was no real connection. He said that drummers drummed for everyone, not just tappers. And a good drummer didn't mean a good tapper. 

### Jane
- Blew out her knee in the 90's - spent 10 years avoid a total knee replacement but finally had to get one (it worked!)
- Went from the Goddess of Tap to the Matriarch of Tap. Talked about the odd transition out of tap and how she had become an underground tap legend, in part because of her contact with the old masters. 
	- All the greats, including Gregory Hines, came out to see her. 
- Met the love of her life, Owen, a painter, while dancing one night in Brooklyn.

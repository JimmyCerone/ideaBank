## Reflections
- Made me miss the Obamas and made me sad that I was so young when they were in office. So much cool stuff that I didn't understand (like the healthier meals). Michelle is so down to earth and honest it was so fun to read this book. From learning about her relationship with Barack to her career as a high powered lawyer, it was so cool to see behind the scenes of her life. 
- I found her narrative about her family to be interesting. I grew up not seeing black families and hearing about hers helped give me an example. Plus, it was touching to hear her talk about her dad and how tough he was. What a man. 
- I related deeply to her desire to do things well and to have structure. 
- I also related to Barack and his desire for hidey holes to study in. It warmed my heart to see someone like him have a similar habit. 
- I was conflicted upon hearing about Barack's political career, especially as I begin to consider one myself. It was so hard on his family, not sure that's something I want to do. 

## Questions
- Is there a way to be involved in politics and the community that doesn't come at the expense of your family?
	- Felt like Grammy and Pop didn't do this super well. It's so hard to strike a balance.

Book about #Drugs and the #Opiod crisis. 

## Connections
- The other side of the coin to [[Murder Mountain]]. Murder mountain is about the source of the hippies and countercultures drugs while Dopesick is more "working class" and hidden / everyday. More denied.
- The same lack of legislation present in [[Lethal Passage - The Story of a Gun by Erik Larson]] was stunning here. Wild that people don't get that [[202104050849 - Offloading responsibility is manipulative]] and people in power use it to make more money. [[202105081805 - People in power tell good stories about their system]] and this is a sad example of it (Perdue). 
- The same destabilizing forces seen in [[Cheap - The High Cost of Discount Culture]] and [[The Elephant and the Dragon by Robyn Meredith]] are seen here because the lack of $ and jobs created a vacuum for drugs
	- Mirrors the power vacuums pointed out by [[Lecrae]] in [[Gangland by Lecrae]] after [[Hellbound on His Trail by Hampton Sides]] & [[The Autobiography of Malcolm X by Malcolm X]] were killed
- Second order consequences from [[Principles by Ray Dalio]] played a big role here. Pharma companies did not think of the second order consequences of removing opiates ([[202105081905 - Binary programs create bad incentives]]) and it led to a spike in heroin usage.

## Facts
- Opium money paid for lots of early US investments and infrastructure. Folks like [[Titan The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.]] made lots of money of it's sale. Britain even went to war over it...
- You can become addicted to opiates in less than 2 weeks
- Interstate crimes are tough to deal with because of inconsistent laws ([[202104060849 - Nationalizing gun laws would improve safety]]). Part of the drawback of [[202104060852 - Enumerate vs reserved powers]]. 
- The frontal lobe actually kind of shuts down during addiction and it takes at least 90 days and sometimes up to two years for it to resume normal functioning which is really a requirement for becoming sober

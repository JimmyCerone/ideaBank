## Summary
- America will decrease in influence and power not necessarily because it is getting worse, but because other countries (China, India, Russia) are growing faster. 
	- So "Making America Great Again" is foolish in part because America isn't necessarily getting worse, but it is not getting as much better as other countries. 


## Reflection
- Fascinating book because it's worldwide bent - I haven't read that many books recently (other than [[Pachinko by Min Jin Lee]] I suppose) that feature new and different perspectives that force me to think like this one has. 


## Connections
- Reminds me of [[The Elephant and the Dragon by Robyn Meredith]] in that it focuses on the continued growth of these countries. Also deeply connected to [[Cheap - The High Cost of Discount Culture]]. Both these books are making me think deeply about my own career and location choices, where I want to live in the future and if that is still America. [[Finland is a Capitalist Paradise by Anu Partanen]] first got me thinking about this but now I'm more deeply considering it. 
- Connects deeply to [[Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport]] and [[Deep Work by Cal Newport]], which both talk about how to differentiate yourself in a global economy. In a way, these books pair well because they help you calm the fears of the other books with practical insights.

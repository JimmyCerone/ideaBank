A fascinating read that is way less pop #Psychology than I thought it would be. Might end up being up there with [[Black Swan by Nassim Taleb]] in how it changes the way I think about doing things. This book so far has been the culmination of lots of personal experimentation from [[Reward Myself for Meditating Daily & Monthly]] to the wall of money / habits. Confirmed my desire to [[Do 1 new habit at a time]]. I was disappointed by the end of this book as it seemed to lose its focus. In the end, I think [[Switch - How to Change Things When Change is Hard by Dan and Chip Heath]] will end up being the Black Swan type book of the two after all.

The first idea to come out of this book is [[Functional vs unnecessary pain]]. The idea of functional vs unecessary pain further connects to the concept of [[Shared realities with different interpretations]] because even within ourselves we can have multitudes of different interpretations of our realities. I often perceive something as insulting while at the same time recognizing I am actually jealous. 

Another idea to come from this and perhaps the most fruitful is [[Mind communicates in images but we speak in words]]. It's almost more like a problem from [[Neil]] and I's work and it reaches deeply into multiple fields, which surprised me. 

## Key Ideas
- The one key idea I want to take away from the book is a better understanding of #Therapy. Like many things, the best therapists know when they need to throw out the rule book. All the techniques, like CBT, are best used as tools rather than dogma.

How has this worked? What strategies do they use?

### Note - Page ix · Location 37

This is fascinating...

### Highlight (blue) - Page x · Location 42

This unconventional , often infuriating , but deeply productive way of working has led to a way of presenting the world and how to think about it , that I never could have created on my own .

## Introduction

### Highlight (blue) - Page 7 · Location 150

The #Democrats and #Republicans in the #UnitedStates often claim that their opponents don’t know the facts . If they measured their own knowledge instead of pointing at each other , maybe everyone could become more humble . When we polled in the United States , only 5 percent picked the right answer . The other 95 percent , regardless of their voting preference , believed either that the extreme poverty rate had not changed over the last 20 years , or , worse , that it had actually doubled — which is literally the opposite of what has actually happened .

- Connection: [[03132021 - One of the best ways to hide your villainy is to create another villain]] - both parties use this liberally. 

### Highlight (blue) - Page 8 · Location 161

In 2017 we asked nearly 12,000 people in 14 countries to answer our questions . They scored on average just two correct answers out of the first 12 . No one got full marks , and just one person ( in Sweden ) got 11 out of 12 . A stunning 15 percent scored zero .

### Highlight (pink) - Page 9 · Location 167

But most of them — a stunning majority of them — get most of the answers wrong . Some of these groups even score worse than the general public ; some of the most appalling results came from a group of Nobel laureates and medical researchers . It is not a question of intelligence . Everyone seems to get the world devastatingly wrong .

### Highlight (pink) - Page 9 · Location 170

Not only devastatingly wrong , but systematically wrong . By which I mean that these test results are not random . They are worse than random : they are worse than the results I would get if the people answering my questions had no knowledge at all .

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 12 · Location 212

Sure , the media plays a role , and I discuss that later , but we must not make them into a pantomime villain . We cannot just shout “ boo , hiss ” at the media .

### Note - Page 12 · Location 214

i love the writing style of this book

### Highlight (orange) - Page 13 · Location 233

At least that’s the picture that most Westerners see in the media and carry around in their heads . I call it the overdramatic worldview . It’s stressful and misleading .

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 13 · Location 237

Step - by - step , year - by - year , the world is improving . Not on every single measure every single year , but as a rule . Though the world faces huge challenges , we have made tremendous progress . This is the fact - based worldview .

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 13 · Location 240

So if your worldview is wrong , then you will systematically make wrong guesses .

### Highlight (blue) - Page 13 · Location 242

And I am convinced it is not the fault of an evil - minded media , propaganda , fake news , or wrong facts .

### Highlight (blue) - Page 14 · Location 253

Knowing that most people are deluded means you don’t need to be embarrassed . Instead you can be curious : how does the illusion work ?

### Note - Page 14 · Location 255

This is the solution to my dilemma!

### Highlight (blue) - Page 15 · Location 259

Our brains often jump to swift conclusions without much thinking , which used to help us to avoid immediate dangers . We are interested in gossip and dramatic stories , which used to be the only source of news and useful information .

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 15 · Location 263

We have to teach our children , and ourselves , to stay away from sweets and chips . In the same way , our quick - thinking

### Note - Page 15 · Location 264

what a fascinating take on this - we have to lear to regulate our information intake.

### Highlight (blue) - Page 15 · Location 265

Don’t misunderstand me . We still need these dramatic instincts to give meaning to our world and get us through the day . If we sifted every input and analyzed every decision rationally , a normal life would be impossible . We should not cut out all sugar and fat , and we should not ask a surgeon to remove the parts of our brain that deal with emotions . But we need to learn to control our drama intake .

### Highlight (blue) - Page 15 · Location 270

It is my last attempt to make an impact on the world : to change people’s ways of thinking , calm their irrational fears , and redirect their energies into constructive activities .

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 16 · Location 274

This is data as you have never known it : it is data as therapy . It is understanding as a source of mental peace . Because the world is not as dramatic as it seems .

### Note - Page 16 · Location 275

Dovetails with my writing on boring

### Highlight (orange) - Page 16 · Location 275

Factfulness , like a healthy diet and regular exercise , can and should become part of your daily life . Start to practice it , and you will be able to replace your overdramatic worldview with a worldview based on facts . You will be able to get the world right without learning it by heart . You will make better decisions , stay alert to real dangers

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 16 · Location 278

I will teach you how to recognize overdramatic stories and give you some thinking tools to control your dramatic instincts .

## Chapter One: The Gap Instinct

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 20 · Location 313

Like a huge thermometer . Because children are very fragile . There are so many things that can kill them .

### Note - Page 20 · Location 314

Like a canary in a mine

### Highlight (pink) - Page 21 · Location 334

I’m talking about that irresistible temptation we have to divide all kinds of things into two distinct and often conflicting groups , with an imagined gap — a huge chasm of injustice — in between . It is about how the gap instinct creates a picture in people’s heads of a world split into two kinds of countries or two kinds of people : rich versus poor .

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 22 · Location 339

I call them mega misconceptions because they have such an enormous impact on how people misperceive the world .

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 22 · Location 344

“ The people you see in exotic documentaries on TV . Those parents struggle harder than anyone to make their families survive , and still they lose almost half of their children . Fortunately , fewer and fewer people have to live under such dreadful conditions . ”

### Note - Page 22 · Location 346

How much is colonialism a problem here? Is he critiqued for that?

### Highlight (blue) - Page 26 · Location 402

This picture clearly shows a world divided into two groups , with a gap in the middle . How nice . What a simple world to understand ! So what’s the big deal ? Why is it so wrong to label countries as “ developed ” and “ developing ” ? Why did I give my student who referred to “ us and them ” such a hard time ? Because this picture shows the world in 1965 !

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 29 · Location 455

Only tiny percentages — way less than the chimps ’ 33 percent — got these answers right , and large majorities picked the worst alternative we offered , even when those numbers represented levels of misery now being suffered only during terrible catastrophes in the very worst places on Earth .

### Note - Page 30 · Location 458

The real question, according to the article I read, is ithis all sustainable...

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 31 · Location 466

To summarize : low - income countries are much more developed than most people think . And vastly fewer people live in them . The idea of a divided world with a majority stuck in misery and deprivation is an illusion . A complete misconception . Simply wrong .

### Note - Page 31 · Location 468

What about variation within countries? And extrimistan from Black Swan?

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 32 · Location 478

The majority of people live neither in low - income countries nor in high - income countries , but in middle - income countries . This category doesn’t exist in the divided mind - set , but in reality it definitely exists . It’s where 75 percent of humanity lives ,

### Note - Page 32 · Location 479

This seems to be a real and important point.

### Highlight (blue) - Page 32 · Location 486

Afterward , people ask me , “ So what should we call them instead ? ” But listen carefully . It’s the same misconception : we and them . What should “ we ” call “ them ” instead ? What we should do is stop dividing countries into two groups . It doesn’t make sense anymore . It doesn’t help us to understand the world in a practical way . It doesn’t help businesses find opportunities , and it doesn’t help aid money to find the poorest people .

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 33 · Location 493

them , I will now suggest an equally simple but more relevant and useful way of dividing up the world .

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 36 · Location 526

Two of your children start high school . If they manage to finish , they will be able to get better - paying jobs than you have ever had . To celebrate , you take the whole family on its first - ever vacation , one afternoon to the beach , just for fun . ( Roughly 2 billion people live like this today . )

### Note - Page 36 · Location 528

So this is where things get sticky because people can stay here or above.

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 38 · Location 539

that it is possible to move through the levels , both for individuals and for countries ; and above all the understanding that there are not just two kinds of lives .

### Note - Page 38 · Location 541

How often do countries move backwards?

### Highlight (pink) - Page 38 · Location 550

I think this is because human beings have a strong dramatic instinct toward binary thinking , a basic urge to divide things into two distinct groups , with nothing but an empty gap in between . We love to dichotomize .

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 39 · Location 557

The gap instinct makes us imagine division where there is just a smooth range , difference where there is convergence , and conflict where there is agreement .

### Note - Page 39 · Location 558

He's describing the world as mediocristan.

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 40 · Location 568

When we compare two averages , we risk misleading ourselves even more by focusing on the gap between those two single numbers , and missing the overlapping spreads , the overlapping ranges of numbers , that make up each average . That is , we see gaps that are not really there .

### Note - Page 40 · Location 570

The reverse can also be true. I see how this book can be one sided.

### Highlight (blue) - Page 41 · Location 586

Of course , gap stories can reflect reality . In apartheid South Africa , black people and white people lived on different income levels and there was a true gap between them , with almost no overlap . The gap story of separate groups was absolutely relevant .

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 44 · Location 615

In the United States , for example , people are classified as below the poverty line even if they live on Level 3 .

### Note - Page 44 · Location 616

So really they should be grateful, right?? Sheesh

### Highlight (blue) - Page 45 · Location 629

extreme poverty on Level 1 know very well how much better life would be if they could move from $ 1 a day to $ 4 a day , not to mention $ 16 a day . People who have to walk everywhere on bare feet know how a bicycle would save them tons of time and effort and speed them to the market in town , and to better health and wealth .

### Highlight (blue) - Page 45 · Location 636

Misconceptions disappear only if there is some equally simple but more relevant way of thinking to replace them . That’s what the four levels do .

### Highlight (blue) - Page 46 · Location 642

To control the gap instinct , look for the majority .

## Chapter Two: The Negativity Instinct

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 47 · Location 653

Which statement do you agree with most ? □ A : The world is getting better . □ B : The world is getting worse . □ C : The world is getting neither better nor worse .

### Note - Page 47 · Location 657

Can't it be both? This seems somewhat reductive....

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 48 · Location 671

This chapter is about the negativity instinct : our tendency to notice the bad more than the good . This instinct is behind the second mega misconception .

### Note - Page 48 · Location 672

This seems very similar to [[The Righteous Mind by Jonathon Haidt]]. Why ara so many books like this coming out around now?

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 49 · Location 674

The number of war fatalities has been falling since the Second World War , but with the Syrian war , the trend has reversed . Terrorism too is rising again . ( We’ll get back to that in chapter 4 . )

### Note - Page 49 · Location 676

Ok he seems a little bit more balanced.

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 49 · Location 681

In order for this planet to have financial stability , peace , and protected natural resources , there’s one thing we can’t do without , and that’s international collaboration , based on a shared and fact - based understanding of the world .

### Note - Page 49 · Location 683

This is exactly what Trump and his supporters are against. It's how he can claim to not be racist as well.

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 53 · Location 726

Today almost everybody has escaped hell . The original source of all human suffering is about to be eradicated . We should plan a party ! A big party ! And when I say “ we , ” I mean humanity !

### Note - Page 53 · Location 728

Fascinating - a quasi religious tone

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 55 · Location 752

There’s a dip in the global life expectancy curve in 1960 because 15 to 40 million people — nobody knows the exact number — starved to death that year in China , in what was probably the world’s largest ever man - made famine .

### Note - Page 55 · Location 754

I had no idea it was that bad... My god.

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 55 · Location 757

the catastrophe was kept secret by the Chinese government for 36 years . It wasn’t described in English to the outside world until 1996 . ( Think about it . Could any government keep the death of 15 million people a global secret today ? )

### Note - Page 56 · Location 759

What the hell? This is absolutely insane...

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 59 · Location 806

Let’s start with 16 terrible things that are on their way out ,

### Note - Page 59 · Location 807

This is spotty predicion - not all of these are guaranteed - especially gas prices and oil spills

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 64 · Location 816

The goal of longer lives is not just extra time . The ultimate goal is to have the freedom to do what we want .

### Note - Page 64 · Location 816

This is an interesting point, that compared to the past things are better. But I think he could do a better job of showing that the trends will continue - and which won't

### Highlight (blue) - Page 65 · Location 822

There are three things going on here : the misremembering of the past ; selective reporting by journalists and activists ; and the feeling that as long as things are bad it’s heartless to say they are getting better .

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 65 · Location 834

When Lasse showed the villagers the 1970s pictures they couldn’t believe the photos were taken in their neighborhood . “ No , ” they said . “ This can’t be here . You must be mistaken . We have never been that poor . ” Like most people , they were living in the moment , busy with new problems , like the children watching immoral soap operas or not having enough money to buy a motorbike .

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 66 · Location 845

Stories about gradual improvements rarely make the front page even when they occur on a dramatic scale and impact millions of people .

### Note - Page 66 · Location 846

Because of our bias, not necessarily any fault of journalists, who are human, too. but the profit model doesn't help

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 66 · Location 848

When central planning resulted in mass famine in rural China , millions starved to death while the youngsters in Europe waving communist red flags knew nothing about it .

### Note - Page 67 · Location 849

I do agree with Black Swan's critique of communism which is the inability to predict.

### Highlight (pink) - Page 68 · Location 860

This illusion of deterioration creates great stress for some people and makes other people lose hope . For no good reason .

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 68 · Location 862

There’s something else going on as well . What are people really thinking when they say the world is getting worse ? My guess is they are not thinking . They are feeling . If you still feel uncomfortable agreeing that the world is getting better , even after I have shown you all this beautiful data , my guess is that it’s because you know that huge problems still remain .

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 68 · Location 865

the world is getting better is like me telling you that everything is fine , or that you should look away from these problems and pretend they don’t exist : and that feels ridiculous , and stressful .

### Note - Page 68 · Location 867

This exactly my experience. Maybe this guy has more merit than I think.

### Highlight (blue) - Page 68 · Location 867

I agree . Everything is not fine . We should still be very concerned . As long as there are plane crashes , preventable child deaths , endangered species , climate change deniers , male chauvinists , crazy dictators , toxic waste , journalists in prison , and girls not getting an education because of their gender , as long as any such terrible things exist , we cannot relax .

### Highlight (blue) - Page 69 · Location 872

That’s something I made up . It means someone who neither hopes without reason , nor fears without reason , someone who constantly resists the overdramatic worldview .

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 69 · Location 879

When women are educated , all kinds of wonderful things happen in societies . The workforce becomes diversified and able to make better decisions and solve more problems . Educated mothers decide to have fewer children and more children survive . More energy and time is invested in each child’s education . It’s a virtuous cycle of change .

### Note - Page 69 · Location 882

Straight out of moment of lift.

### Highlight (blue) - Page 70 · Location 894

The solution is not to balance out all the negative news with more positive news . That would just risk creating a self - deceiving , comforting , misleading bias in the other direction . It would be as helpful as balancing too much sugar with too much salt . It would make things more exciting , but maybe even less healthy .

### Note - Page 70 · Location 896

This is key. I always try to do this.

## Chapter Three: The Straight Line Instinct

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 84 · Location 1064

The UN experts are not predicting that the number of children will stop increasing . They are reporting

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 85 · Location 1078

Nothing drastic is needed . Just more of what we are already doing . The exact speed of the future drop is not possible to predict exactly . It depends on how fast these changes continue to happen . But in any case , the annual number of births in the world has already stopped increasing , which means that the period of fast population growth will soon be over .

### Highlight (pink) - Page 89 · Location 1121

people come up to me after the presentation and tell me that the charts can’t be correct because , you know , “ People in Africa and Latin America still have many children . And religious people refuse contraceptives and still have huge families . ”

### Highlight (blue) - Page 91 · Location 1144

If more children survive , the population just increases . Right ? No ! Completely wrong .

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 91 · Location 1152

The only proven method for curbing population growth is to eradicate extreme poverty and give people better lives , including education and contraceptives . Across the world , parents then have chosen for themselves to have fewer children .

### Note - Page 93 · Location 1175

Growth by smil

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 98 · Location 1225

Most people’s incomes grow much slower than bacteria , unfortunately . Still , even if your income increases by only 2 percent a year , after 35 years it will have doubled . And then , if you maintain 2 percent growth , in another 35 years it will have doubled again . Over 200 years — if you lived that long — it would double six times , which is exactly what we saw in Sweden’s bubble trail in the last chapter , and which is typically the slow and steady way countries have moved from Level 1 to Level 4 .

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 98 · Location 1232

That’s life - changing for you . The world is extremely unfair , but doubling one’s income , from any starting point , is always life - changing . I use this doubling scale whenever I compare income because that’s how money works .

## Chapter Four: The Fear Instinct

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 103 · Location 1284

When we are afraid , we do not see clearly . I was a young doctor facing my first emergency , and I had always been terrified by the prospect of a third world war . As a child , I often had nightmares about it . I would wake up and run to my parents ’ bed . I could be calmed only by my father going over the details of our plan one more time : we would take our tent in the bike trailer and go live in the woods where there were plenty of blueberries .

### Highlight (blue) - Page 103 · Location 1289

There’s no room for facts when our minds are occupied by fear .

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 104 · Location 1303

If we are not extremely careful , we come to believe that the unusual is usual : that this is what the world looks like .

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 105 · Location 1311

Fears of physical harm , captivity , and poison once helped our ancestors survive . In modern times , perceptions of these dangers still trigger our fear instinct . You can spot stories about them in the news every day :

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 106 · Location 1331

On Levels 3 and 4 , where life is less physically demanding and people can afford to protect themselves against nature , these biological memories probably cause more harm than good .

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 107 · Location 1339

Yet here’s the paradox : the image of a dangerous world has never been broadcast more effectively than it is now , while the world has never been less violent and more safe .

### Highlight (blue) - Page 107 · Location 1340

Fears that once helped keep our ancestors alive , today help keep journalists employed . It isn’t the journalists ’ fault and we shouldn’t expect them to change . It isn’t driven by “ media logic ” among the producers so much as by “ attention logic ” in the heads of the consumers .

### Highlight (pink) - Page 109 · Location 1367

Back in 1942 , Bangladesh was on Level 1 and almost all its citizens were illiterate farmers . Over a two - year period it suffered terrible floods , droughts , and cyclones . No international organization came to the rescue and 2 million people died .

Probably what’s was guiding the trump supporter I argued with on LinkedIn

having died from the very thing that people were fleeing from . These 1,600 people died because they escaped . They were mainly old people who died because of the mental and physical stresses of the evacuation itself or of life in evacuation shelters . It wasn’t radioactivity , but the fear of radioactivity , that killed them . ( Even after the worst - ever nuclear accident , Chernobyl in 1986 , when most people expected a huge increase in the death rate , the WHO investigators could not confirm this , even among those living in the area . )

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 116 · Location 1465

In a devastating example of critical thinking gone bad , highly educated , deeply caring parents avoid the vaccinations that would protect their children from killer diseases . I love critical thinking and I admire skepticism , but only within a framework that respects the evidence . So if you are skeptical about the measles vaccination , I ask you to do two things . First , make sure you know what it looks like when a child dies from measles . Most children who catch measles recover , but there is still no cure and even with the best modern medicine , one or two in every thousand will die of it . Second , ask yourself , “ What kind of evidence would convince me to change my mind ? ” If the answer is “ no evidence could ever change my mind about vaccination , ” then you are putting yourself outside evidence - based rationality , outside the very critical thinking that first brought you to this point . In that case , to be consistent in your skepticism about science , next time you have an operation please ask your surgeon not to bother washing her hands .

DDT should be used with great caution , but there are pros and cons . In refugee camps teeming with mosquitoes , for example , DDT is often one of the quickest and cheapest ways to save lives .

This chapter has touched on terrifying events : natural disasters ( 0.1 percent of all deaths ) , plane crashes ( 0.001 percent ) , murders ( 0.7 percent ) , nuclear leaks ( 0 percent ) , and terrorism ( 0.05 percent ) . None of them kills more than 1 percent of the people who die each year , and still they get enormous media attention .

### Highlight (orange) - Page 123 · Location 1551

Factfulness is … recognizing when frightening things get our attention , and remembering that these are not necessarily the most risky . Our natural fears of violence , captivity , and contamination make us systematically overestimate these risks .

This is handy for business as well...

## Chapter Five: The Size Instinct

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 127 · Location 1612

“ In the deepest poverty you should never do anything perfectly . If you do you are stealing resources from where they can be better used . ”

### Highlight (blue) - Page 127 · Location 1613

Paying too much attention to the individual visible victim rather than to the numbers can lead us to spend all our resources on a fraction of the problem , and therefore save many fewer lives . This principle applies anywhere we are prioritizing scarce resources .

I had no idea. Where is the history of these wars?

In Sweden , a fatal bear attack is a once - in - a - century event . Meanwhile , a woman is killed by her partner every 30 days . This is a 1,300 - fold difference in magnitude . And yet one more domestic murder had barely registered , while the hunting death was big news .

That is all there is to the 80 / 20 rule . We tend to assume that all items on a list are equally important , but usually just a few of them are more important than all the others put together .

We can understand the world better , and make better decisions about it , if we know where the biggest proportion of the population lives now and where it will live in the future .

Yes , I think the Western domination of the world economy will soon be over .

Amounts are easier to find because they are easier to produce . Somebody just needs to count something . But rates are often more meaningful .

### Highlight (orange) - Page 140 · Location 1790

“ But from now on we count carbon dioxide emission per person . ”

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 142 · Location 1809

What should this lonely number be compared to ? What was that number a year ago ? Ten years ago ? What is it in a comparable country or region ? And what should it be divided by ? What is the total of which this is a part ? What would this be per person ? I compare the rates , and only then do I decide whether it really is an important number .

## Chapter Six: The Generalization Instinct

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 146 · Location 1857

The necessary and useful instinct to generalize , like all the other instincts in this book , can also distort our worldview . It can make us mistakenly group together things , or people , or countries that are actually very different . It can make us assume everything or everyone in one category is similar . And , maybe most unfortunate of all , it can make us jump to conclusions about a whole category based on a few , or even just one , unusual example .

### Note - Page 150 · Location 1908

This is wild. Is it good?

### Highlight (blue) - Page 150 · Location 1915

One of the best ways to do this is to travel , if you possibly can . That’s why I made my global health students from Karolinska Institutet , the medical university in Stockholm , go on study visits to countries on Levels 1 , 2 , and 3 , where they attended university courses , visited hospitals , and stayed with local families . Nothing beats a firsthand experience .

### Highlight (yellow) - Page 151 · Location 1926

Flaking walls keep away the richer patients and their time - consuming demands for costly treatments , allowing hospitals to use their limited resources to treat more people in more cost - effective ways .

Yet this is very common on Level 2 : the public health system can pay for some diagnosis , for emergency care , and for inexpensive drugs . This leads to great improvements in survival rates .

We Swedes are known for being quite liberal and open about sex and contraception , aren’t we ? Yet this hasn’t always been our culture . These haven’t always been our values .

We find simple ideas very attractive . We enjoy that moment of insight , we enjoy feeling we really understand or know something . And it is easy to take off down a slippery slope , from one attention - grabbing simple idea to a feeling that this idea beautifully explains , or is the beautiful solution for , lots of other things . The world becomes simple . All problems have a single cause — something we must always be completely against . Or all problems have a single solution — something we must always be for . Everything is simple . There’s just one small issue . We completely misunderstand the world . I call this preference for single causes and single solutions the single perspective instinct .

• Insist on the data . If something is urgent and important , it should be measured . Beware of data that is relevant but inaccurate , or accurate but irrelevant . Only relevant and accurate data is useful . • Beware of fortune - tellers . Any prediction about the future is uncertain . Be wary of predictions that fail to acknowledge that . Insist on a full range of scenarios , never just the best or worst case . Ask how often such predictions have been right before . • Be wary of drastic action . Ask what the side effects will be . Ask how the idea has been tested . Step - by - step practical improvements , and evaluation of their impact , are less dramatic but usually more effective .

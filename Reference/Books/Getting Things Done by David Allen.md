## Summary
- My interpretation of the process is here: [[Getting Things Done Process]]
- Open loops cause stress
	- The goal is to capture all of them in an "in" tray that is then reliable processed into a trusted system (for me, [[Obsidian]])
		- This distinction between an "in-tray" and next actions is something I missed at first, but now I'm starting to appreciate. Finally got around to creating an in tray in [[Obsidian]] and I'm excited to start processing through stuff.
		> The in-tray is a processing station, not a storage bin
		> Nothing goes back to "In"
- Defining next actions removes thinking when doing. So you can do without considering "what" needs to be done
	- This was revolutionary for me as so many of my todos were so vague that they were intimidating.
> The primary reason for organizing is to reduce cognitive load - i.e. to eliminate the need to constantly be thinking, "What do I need to do about this?"
- Calendars can be used like [[Neil]] does, to: 
	- Trigger activation of projects
	- Events I might want to participate in (put in questions!)
	- Decision catalysts

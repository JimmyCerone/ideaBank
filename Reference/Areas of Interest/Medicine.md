- Regulation
	- 	There are folks like Naval and Balaji ([[202103182008 - The Evolutionary Angel]] & [[202103291336 - The Episode of Everything - Balaji on Bitcoin]]) who argue that [[202104011451 - FDA imposes unecessary regulations]]. Balaji advocated for a [[Yelp]] style replacement where Doctors and Patients can review drug results for themselves.

- Their lungs are outside their body. 
- They are both carnivores and photosynthesizes
	- In addition, they are cannibalistic
> Nudibranchs are simultaneous hermaphrodites, and can mate with any other mature member of their species. Their lifespan varies widely, with some living less than a month, and others living up to one year.

I think based on my tendencies to go to extremes, I should not day trade #Cryptocurrency. I am trying to earn it through the 1729 project from [[202103291336 - The Episode of Everything - Balaji on Bitcoin]] and have earned some on Coinbase to get started, but I'm not sure where to go next. 

I'm pretty sure Crypto is like a 50 year trend so even though everyone is telling me to rush, I think that's the wrong move and I have time. I think had I known about this 10 years ago, I'd be rushing to buy crypto. I still think there's lot of room to grow, but I think becoming an investor is the wrong move. 

I am working on learning crypto related languages and stuff, with the hopes that I can apply that at work. But, right now my primary strategy is to earn crypto, which I have no idea how to do. I don't want to buy it. 

There's this weird credit card called [[Fold]] that I've considered using which rewards you for spending. But it feels kind of scammy to me. 

Part of me believes that building on the block chain is the way to go, but I'm not 1000% sure about that. In the article that spawned the idea about [[04082021 - Decentralized Autonomous Organizations]], they talked about gold rush mentality - sell the tools don't look for the gold. I'm not quite sure how to do that yet, but I think it's what I want to do. 

For now, I gotta get a crypt wallet or whatever you call it first.

I'm reflecting on this question as a result of [[202103291336 - The Episode of Everything - Balaji on Bitcoin]] and [[The Age of Surveillance Capitalism by Soshona Zuboff]] and [[Why Don't We Just Ban Targeted Advertising]]. Things are coming to a boiling point and we are in danger of falling behind (is that even the right way to think about it?) according to [[The Elephant and the Dragon by Robyn Meredith]]. I'm unsure how things will land here. #Cryptocurrency seems to be a proposed answer here but it's very Liberterian and I'm not sure it's as thoughtful as [[Nudge]]. What's interesting is that China is taking steps here and the US is just contemplating (https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/china-regulation-data-collection-may-starts/). I'm so conflicted on this issue because of the Tim Ferris podcast. It was so one sided that I'm not sure where to land on things.

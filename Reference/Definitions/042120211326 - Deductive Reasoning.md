> Deductive reasoning goes in the same direction as that of the conditionals, and links [premises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premise "Premise") with [conclusions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequent "Consequent"). If all premises are true, the terms are [clear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unambiguous "Unambiguous"), and the rules of deductive [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic") are followed, then the conclusion reached is [necessarily true](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_necessity "Logical necessity").
> Deductive reasoning (_"top-down logic"_) contrasts with [inductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning "Inductive reasoning") (_"bottom-up logic"_): in deductive reasoning, a conclusion is reached [reductively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism "Reductionism") by applying general rules which hold over the entirety of a [closed domain of discourse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-world_assumption "Closed-world assumption"), narrowing the range under consideration until _only_ the conclusion(s) remains. In deductive reasoning there is no [epistemic uncertainty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty "Uncertainty").[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning#cite_note-Zi-2) In inductive reasoning, the conclusion is reached by generalizing or extrapolating from specific cases to general rules resulting in a conclusion that has epistemic uncertainty.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning#cite_note-Zi-2)

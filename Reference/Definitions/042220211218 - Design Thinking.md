Bad Definition from [[Product Development Talk with Matt Fletcher]]: 
- Get out a persona and a couple of sketches and you do activities to design stuff
	- These are design methods

Better Definition from Matt:
- How do I solve this other persons problem such that I do such a good job that they are willing to compensate me for it. 
- Requires digging deeply into what is under the complaint, in part because [[03-03-2021 - Our language creates our reality]] and thus [[Shared realities with different interpretations]]. The goal is to get to the why, the motivator behind a complaint. Design thinking pushes past solutions (which are often presented in complaints) down to problems and back up
	- Interview question related to this is what's the difference between Art and Design? 
		- [[042220211218 - Design]] is when I'm making something for someone else while [[042220211218 - Art]] is when I'm making it for myself.

> What studies show is that repeating something to yourself over and over without pausing between repetitions – called massed repetition – is only slightly better than not repeating the information at all.

You are most likely to remember something later if you repeat it using spaced repetitions. This means that you repeat the information over and over, but you put some time in between the repetitions. For example, after being introduced to someone, you might repeat the name after five seconds, repeat it again after another five seconds, and yet again after five more seconds.

A contest definition, but here is the one from [[Black Power and Black Theology by James Cone]]: 

> Authentic freedom has nothing to do with the rugged individualism of laissez faire, the right of the businessman to pursue without restraint the profit motive or the pleasure principle which is extolled by Western capitalistic democracies. On the contrary, authentic freedom is grounded in the awareness of the universal finality of man and the agonizing responsibility of choosing between perplexing alternatives regarding his existence.

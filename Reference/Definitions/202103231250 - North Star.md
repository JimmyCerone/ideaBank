A term used in #Design. 

## Definition
> **A north star is a guiding light that helps align a team on the plan for the product, showing how the pieces will fit together.** Without it, you're liable to miss the opportunity to #Innovation, are likely to neglect the long-term, and are probably turning your product into a disjointed Frankenstein lacking consistency.

## Reflection
- North stars seem easy to forget and the lack of them likely plays into the [[03132021 - Bad things happen slowly]]. Without one, my guess is you slowly drift away from good design.

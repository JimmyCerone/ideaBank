>The basic form of the problem is the following: imagine an administrator who wants to hire the best secretary out of  n   {\\displaystyle n} ![n](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b) rankable applicants for a position. The applicants are interviewed one by one in random order. A decision about each particular applicant is to be made immediately after the interview. Once rejected, an applicant cannot be recalled. During the interview, the administrator gains information sufficient to rank the applicant among all applicants interviewed so far, but is unaware of the quality of yet unseen applicants. The question is about the optimal strategy ([stopping rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stopping_rule "Stopping rule")) to maximize the probability of selecting the best applicant.
>The shortest rigorous proof known so far is provided by the [odds algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_algorithm "Odds algorithm"). It implies that the optimal win probability is always at least  1  /  e   {\\displaystyle 1/e} ![1/e](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f3f5e6342b5d465a51daf323f383ed1c8e51f43f) (where _[e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant) "E (mathematical constant)")_ is the base of the [natural logarithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_logarithm "Natural logarithm")), and that the latter holds even in a much greater generality. The optimal stopping rule prescribes always rejecting the first  âˆ¼ n  /  e   {\\displaystyle \\sim n/e} ![{\displaystyle \sim n/e}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/eac44351ea2cf41399c5a676764de2d018d28c67) applicants that are interviewed and then stopping at the first applicant who is better than every applicant interviewed so far (or continuing to the last applicant if this never occurs).

Fascinating issue and relates deeply to my [[Limit my consumption of books and articles]]. I'm not quite sure how to apply it, but I think I could use it to pick an article at the end of the day. 

So if I have 7 articles waiting in Firefox at the end of the day, I'd reject the first 3 automatically and then take the first article after that that is better than the rest. Will have to remember this as an update in [[Week of 04-17-2021 to 04-23-2021]].

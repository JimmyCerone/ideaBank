## Definition
- A query within a query. 
	- Can be used in the from clause, for filter, or even as a column. 
- Kind of similar to [[202106031332 - Common Table Entry (CTE)]]. Different in ways I'm not clear on. First learned about it in [[Head First SQL]]. 

## Example
- As simple as adding parentheses and adding a query inside of them. 
```SELECT * FROM TABLE WHERE TABLE.COLUMN = (SELECT * FROM TABLE2 WHERE TABLE2.COLUMN1 = 5)```

> It is also described as a method where one's experiences and observations, including what are learned from others, are synthesized to come up with a general truth.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning#cite_note-2) Many dictionaries define inductive reasoning as the derivation of general principles from specific observations (arguing from specific to general), although there are many inductive arguments that do not have that form.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning#cite_note-3)
> Inductive reasoning is distinct from [_deductive_ reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning "Deductive reasoning"). If the premises are correct, the conclusion of a deductive argument is _certain_; in contrast, the truth of the conclusion of an inductive argument is _[probable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probable "Probable")_, based upon the evidence given.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning#cite_note-4)

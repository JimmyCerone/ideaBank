- Basically #College theme #House from #Hope except terrible execution. This seems like a breeding ground for ethics violations. Curious to hear what [[Neil]] would think of it. An interesting way to do #Community, but not sure that it's a good one. 

Update after reading more. This is a bad long term idea, but an interesting short term idea for folks travelling, kind of like [[Brian Helfman]] is doing. 

Ties into the idea of carsharing and building a local community. Could be an interesting way to merge local life with travel.

		- Pre built in (think wifi)

## Pros
- Brings together diverse expertise a la [[Range]].

	- There are some interesting takes on this as well: http://www.dancingrabbit.org/
- Cheaper
- Flexibility 
	- Month to month leases
- Comfort

- Structure


## Cons
- Here are some problems: 
	- Lack of boundaries (proud of no lockers)
	- Screens for interest, not living compatibility (very different)
	- Lacks revenue stream of a #College
	- Lack of roots: 
		> People, it seems, are becoming fungible, and, as in a game of pinball, you score points by bumping up against as many of them as possible.
		- Seems to be a problem with the sharing economy as a whole. I like "this car" vs I just need a car. Where do we draw the line? What would [[Shop Class as Soulcraft - An Inquiry into the Value of Work]] say about all this?


## Questions
- How do colleges do this well or badly? 
- What differs post college?

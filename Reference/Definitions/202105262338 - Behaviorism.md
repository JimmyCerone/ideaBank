The idea that our actions are predetermined, that we lack free will like [[202104231116 - Computers lack free will]]. It is fundamentally an industrial metaphor ([[202105181617 - Humans are becoming more like machines]]) even though it's purportedly supported by "scientific research". The problem is, according to [[Punished by Rewards by Alfie Kohn]] (and even [[Switch - How to Change Things When Change is Hard by Dan and Chip Heath]] obliquely), that the studies that show we are simply the result of certain rewards or punishments are circumscribed. They take starving rats in cages and try to generalize that to humans (or even rats that are full). Reminds me of [[202104211317 - Inductive reasoning is often misused when addressing systemic problems]].

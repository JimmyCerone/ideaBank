## Definition 
- A query which we create before writing the main query. 
	- Then, using the AS operator, we use it as a regular table inside the code. 
- This is when you use the `WITH AS (SQL)` structure when using #SQL. The advantage of this is that it's easy and clear while the disadvantage as pointed out in [[Head First SQL]] and by Lydia is that it is rather inefficient and slow (since it is kind of related to [[202106031440 - Subquery]])

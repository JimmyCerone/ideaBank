## Definition
- Groups with no central management. Individuals coordinate around a shared set of rules to achieve a common goal.

## Reflection
- This feels a lot like [[The Dispossessed by Ursula K. Le Guin]], which is fascinating. I never made the connection but #OpenSource and #Cryptocurrency are in their own way #Anarchy, which as I spoke with Joe, is like the end goal of #Libertarian s. Not sure how I feel about #Anarchy given it's connection with #Libertarian, which I'm unsure about, but folks like Balaji in [[202103291336 - The Episode of Everything - Balaji on Bitcoin]] talk highly of it because of the emphasis on #Consent.
- #Bitcoin and #Ethereum are DAOs, which is interesting because those are becoming so mainstream even as they connect with something so outside mainstream like #Anarchy.

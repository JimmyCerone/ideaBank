# Idea

The ability to pay for things like #Articles in mini #Transactions that #Cost fractions of #Money. 

## Example
I could pay for an article in my read time - like [[Medium]] except if I only paid for what I read (instead of the #Subscription model). Also like what [[Brave]] tried to do back in the day with their payment system. 

## Problem
- You can't quite do this because while #Computer s can, #Human s can't. The cost of making tons of micro transactions is very high for humans because we have to make that many #Decisions, which is super hard.

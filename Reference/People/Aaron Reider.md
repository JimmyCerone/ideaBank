- Sleep
	- Had trouble going to bed by 11 but tried - routine thing
	- Routine
		- The one that worked best was reading an article and drawing my day on the [[Remarkable]]. 
- "One of the killers of awe is technology because it puts everything at our fingertips so we aren't excited"
	- Awe is a big part of happiness. 
	- "I have an all you can eat buffet of knowledge which isn't good for me."
- Approach tech with curiosity
- Focus on relational things
	- Tech is non-relational ([[03102021 - Not all tech is helpful]])
	- What is our relationship with the world, each other, and more? 

## [[2021-06-14]]
- Is shmoozing holding me back from promoting my ideas?
	- Since I'm afraid of shmoozing, I hold back ideas. What if what I think of shmoozing isn't shmoozing but being direct?
		- Ambition is efficient. 
		- What if i were to lose the judgement around working towards a goal?
- "You will show up best in your relationships if you are satisfying your desires."
- Exhaust your routes in the W2 world
	- Be efficient in exploring the roles and flexibility 
	- At work right now, "The fun things are meaningless and the meaningful things are not fun"
- 11 PM and body scan

- LA
	- Jobs
		- Never take a pay cut when choosing a new job (negotiate your salary)
		- How do I view myself as a professional? 
			- As kind of bumbling idiot. I don't view myself as particularly successful. Other organizations are looking for someone that believes in themselves. Don't get caught in the humble card. 
				- Telling people about your experience is bridging interests. It's only bragging if you don't reciprocate. 
					- Why do I devalue the work I've done? 
						- I don't want to be vulnerable and I don't want to be intimidating. 
							- What happens then is I bottle up everything in my life and share it with one or two people. 
							- Professionally this is a disadvantage. 
- [[Punished by Rewards by Alfie Kohn]]
- [[Atomic Object]]
	- You could work remote and be an exception
	- Do I like it or not?
- What would it look like to throw the confidence I have inwardly outwardly in my professional life?
	- You will bump up against people who push back because of fear in them, not criticism of you. 

## [[2021-06-01]]
- Worried about:
	- Returning to the office
		- Talk with Liv about going to LA
	- Returning to social life (https://world.hey.com/jimmy.cerone/social-life-it-s-a-thing-again-f85d2bd4)
		- Could be overthinking because you just may not know until you get there. There is no predicting social life ([[202103261112 - The future is inherently unpredictable]]). We convince ourselves that we are right more often than we are because we only remember the times we are right. We have lots of biases here as well. 
- Initiating Sex with [[Liv Panozzo]]
	- Ask how she would like me to initiate it
	- Explicitly ask (and be ok with saying no and bring up an alternative)
- Explicitly say what you want out of a conversation
	- Ask that you want to vent
- Thinking about:
	- Teaching
		- Maybe not professor (Dr. Ortiz wrote an email about this)
			- Limited number of jobs
			- Grad school is inhumane
			- Only go if getting paid
		- Maybe not a teacher
			- High workload (60 hours a week)
		- Maybe accelerator manager? 
			- Ask [[Jesse Hill]] about this in coaching
		- Maybe not a traditional route?
			- Get a Master's degree and build a name for yourself (Kylen's route)

- Information without context is emotionally draining - there is no place to connect emotionally. 
	- By adding context I can make the conversation more engaging for [[Liv Panozzo]]. 
	- "Just because the information is relevant to me doesn't mean it's relevant to others."
		- Imagine Aaron comes home from work and downloads his whole day to his partner. It would be like 8 hours of information and imagine her listening to that every day. 
		- That's what the information download is. It's simply information to them but to me it's super interesting. 
	- Liv is looking to understand *why the information matters to me*. She isn't interested in the information, but the impact of the information on me. 
- Partner doesn't need to be everything for you
	- I have friends that are interested in just the ideas without the meaning. 
- Long Distance
	- Everyday is not always the best way to do it
- "Feelings aren't bad. Feelings are valuable."


## Action Items
- [ ] Work on awareness in relationships
	- [ ] Start with adding meaning to conversations with Liv
- [ ] Read up on long distance
- [ ] Talk about what type of communication you want later
- [ ] What is meaningful about the information?

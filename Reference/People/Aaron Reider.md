- Information without context is emotionally draining - there is no place to connect emotionally. 
	- By adding context I can make the conversation more engaging for [[Liv Panozzo]]. 
	- "Just because the information is relevant to me doesn't mean it's relevant to others."
		- Imagine Aaron comes home from work and downloads his whole day to his partner. It would be like 8 hours of information and imagine her listening to that every day. 
		- That's what the information download is. It's simply information to them but to me it's super interesting. 
	- Liv is looking to understand *why the information matters to me*. She isn't interested in the information, but the impact of the information on me. 
- Partner doesn't need to be everything for you
	- I have friends that are interested in just the ideas without the meaning. 
- Long Distance
	- Everyday is not always the best way to do it
- "Feelings aren't bad. Feelings are valuable."

## Meeting [[2021-05-27]]

- Rockford ride is mostly flat and relaxing
	- That said, if it's like Jason and Patrick and Adam on the ride, then it can get going pretty fast. 
- Professional Development
	- 2 hour long blocks a week
	- Could I co opt this and build it into my reading habit
		- Audio Book
		- Kindle Book
		- Work book
		- Physical book
	- Think about this in terms of [[Switch - How to Change Things When Change is Hard by Dan and Chip Heath]]
		- I have to figure out why this is worth doing and figure out the specific actions that get me the most benefit. 
			- Why do I need to learn the basics of SQL? 
				- Because I feel like Jason and others expect me to lead features and to do that I need to know the basics of SQL. 
					- Right now I'm using a terrible strategy, which is basically [[Punished by Rewards by Alfie Kohn]]. 
						- I'm direct the rider but not motivating the elephant ([[The Righteous Mind by Jonathon Haidt]])
					- Prof dev can feel like self-care (if done well)
				- The problem here is that I'm not particularly interested in leading a feature... 
				- Motivations
					- Incorporate it into my ideas
					- Builds credibility for my ideas so that people give me more influence
				- Have to feel like you are getting value and feeling like you are progressing
					- Make a plan
						- I have two problems, the elephant is not motivated and the path is not clear
							- Elephant can be motivated by making this about my ideas - it's part of what I do and a new source for ideas instead of working against it. 
							- Path can be cleared up by creating an end date, scheduling sessions to learn and writing down how I will do my work. 
					- GOAL: Finish SQL Book by the end of June. By doing 2 sessions per week. 

## Meeting [[2021-05-20]]

- Talk about conversation with [[Jordan Nelson]] and how to deal with passiveness getting in the way of growth
	- Talk about my experience vs [[Jason Porritt]]'s goal - why such a big gap?
		- Jason is more experienced & sees the long term nature of this. I'm freaked out because it's the first time and Jason is not because he's seen this a million times. 
	- talk about learning & Jordan
		- Be more direct with asks:
			- Driving
			- Breaks
			- Teaching
		- CPR is happening now
			- C is for an event you notice
			- P is a pattern 
			- R is relationship trouble
- Talk about how to deal with Matt...

Feedback
- Don't quite on VIM, get better at it on your own time
- Walking Blue during group discussions is not working
	- Coaching is more ok
	- Folks deserve max Jimmy and folks are not getting max Jimmy this way
- Not ramping in as fast as normal
	- Great accelerators have had this feedback before, not a crazy thing
		- Typically because communication is not working enough to get people what they need. 
	- This deserves my full attention and it matters to me
		- Double down on Prof Dev
			- SQL
			- VIM
			- Typescript
	- What if driving looks like I drive until Jordan gets frustrated with a thing and then I go and learn about it.

MISSION CRITICAL [[Switch - How to Change Things When Change is Hard by Dan and Chip Heath]].

UVP of Atomic as an Employer: 
- Our best value is the people and community at Atomic


Facts:
- [[03062021 - Levers]]:
	- Roughly at peak rate right now
	- Maxed out profit margin


Problems:
- Senior atoms aren't making the case for going back into the office
	- This means that it's not that valuable


Things we can't compete on:
- Salary
	- We can't offer tons of salary 
- Remote Work
	- We kind of die as a consultancy if we go remote
- Interesting work
	- We don't have the most interesting work ever

- Spin
- Break Culture
	- Especially for folks who are new to the company who need psychological safety to ask for breaks
	- Might be as simple as leading by example (doing it the way you think it should be done)
		- What is your vision for the end goal? Run this through the switch framework. 
			- Healthier & happier atomic object
				- Create humor and positivity
		- Brown bag topic
			- Find the bright spots
			- Come up with productive breaks
				- Take 15 minutes to come up with compliment for a coworkers
				- Take 15 minutes to come up with a dad joke
				- Take 5 minutes to do a BuddyMove workout
	- Write spin posts about timers
		- [[202105041057 - Timers decrease decision fatigue]] & [[Utilize timers to set boundaries for yourself and others]]
- Atomic Brain Trust
	- Slack plugin
		- Wraps up content and sends it to people to learn
	- Punch IT
		- Annotating it with tech stacks
			- Who is a subject matter expert
			- Areas for atomic to double down on
	- Spin Culture
		- NLP fun stuff on spin posts
	- AI Writing
		- People would be love this if they could have a bot that writes most of their post and they can just edit it. 
		- Tons of people have discomfort with the fact that spin is above and beyond. 
		- Slack plug in that auto suggests spin topics
			- Could be super simple - highest number of threads 
	- WIKI
		- Person focused
			- have people's hot takes on various tech
		- We have to focus on information that is so specific to Atomic that the internet can't do it for us
			- Wiki about react would not out perform stack overflow
		- Challenge is determining what type of content would be valuable
			- Onboarding esque would be the most valuable type of thing
- Outreach on business philosophy

## Meeting 04-23-2021

- Most people at [[Atomic Object]] are internally focused. There is definitely space for business development in an outward facing role that I could build towards. I like the idea of being an Ambassador for Atomic Object. 
- Be careful when addressing issues of creating disrespect. That is triggering and it's best to avoid unless necessary.
- When updating people, add why to your response so people don't have to wonder why you are prioritizing the way you are. Connected to [[202104161040 - Only gives commitments for things you can control]]. 
	- So in this case, I could have added why I had to wait (meeting with Jason) which would give him the chance to response based on priorities.

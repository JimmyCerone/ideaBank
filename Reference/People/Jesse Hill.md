MISSION CRITICAL [[Switch - How to Change Things When Change is Hard by Dan and Chip Heath]].

UVP of Atomic as an Employer: 
- Our best value is the people and community at Atomic


Facts:
- [[03062021 - Levers]]:
	- Roughly at peak rate right now
	- Maxed out profit margin


Problems:
- Senior atoms aren't making the case for going back into the office
	- This means that it's not that valuable


Things we can't compete on:
- Salary
	- We can't offer tons of salary 
- Remote Work
	- We kind of die as a consultancy if we go remote
- Interesting work
	- We don't have the most interesting work ever

- Spin
- Break Culture
	- Especially for folks who are new to the company who need psychological safety to ask for breaks
	- Might be as simple as leading by example (doing it the way you think it should be done)
		- What is your vision for the end goal? Run this through the switch framework. 
			- Healthier & happier atomic object
				- Create humor and positivity
		- Brown bag topic
			- Find the bright spots
			- Come up with productive breaks
				- Take 15 minutes to come up with compliment for a coworkers
				- Take 15 minutes to come up with a dad joke
				- Take 5 minutes to do a BuddyMove workout
	- Write spin posts about timers
		- [[202105041057 - Timers decrease decision fatigue]] & [[Utilize timers to set boundaries for yourself and others]]
- Atomic Brain Trust
	- Slack plugin
		- Wraps up content and sends it to people to learn
	- Punch IT
		- Annotating it with tech stacks
			- Who is a subject matter expert
			- Areas for atomic to double down on
	- Spin Culture
		- NLP fun stuff on spin posts
	- AI Writing
		- People would be love this if they could have a bot that writes most of their post and they can just edit it. 
		- Tons of people have discomfort with the fact that spin is above and beyond. 
		- Slack plug in that auto suggests spin topics
			- Could be super simple - highest number of threads 
	- WIKI
		- Person focused
			- have people's hot takes on various tech
		- We have to focus on information that is so specific to Atomic that the internet can't do it for us
			- Wiki about react would not out perform stack overflow
		- Challenge is determining what type of content would be valuable
			- Onboarding esque would be the most valuable type of thing
- Outreach on business philosophy

## Meeting 04-23-2021

- Most people at [[Atomic Object]] are internally focused. There is definitely space for business development in an outward facing role that I could build towards. I like the idea of being an Ambassador for Atomic Object. 
- Be careful when addressing issues of creating disrespect. That is triggering and it's best to avoid unless necessary.
- When updating people, add why to your response so people don't have to wonder why you are prioritizing the way you are. Connected to [[202104161040 - Only gives commitments for things you can control]]. 
	- So in this case, I could have added why I had to wait (meeting with Jason) which would give him the chance to response based on priorities.

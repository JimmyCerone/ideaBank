## Meeting [[2021-06-24]]
- Quarterly Rock - [[Quarter 3 2021]]
	- Typescript Primer
		- Which course?
			- The 
- Working a night a week
	- Intentionally working when you have no help is not good for the client
		- Work till you get stuck or have multiple things to work on so you can switch if you are stuck
- Pairing - "Easier to change my own thinking than someone else's"
	- More asking questions than telling
	- Frustrations
		- Working at night
			- Overnight retro to talk about the progress since last time
		- Copying and pasting
			- Suggestions vs "shoulding"
		- Competing vibes
			- Identify competition as dangerous and figure out how to go the other way
				- Defuse by showing what it feels like in subtle ish ways.
		- Framing as questions
			- I was frustrated that he didn't do this super well. How did I do?
				- "I think I got it - let me explain it to you."
				- Make it clear what kind of feedback you want
					- Is this a rough draft? Is this a final draft?
	- People like helpful suggestions more than being told what to do -> this is a way of helping people level up

## Meeting [[2021-06-15]]
- [[Head First SQL]]
- Working with Patrick
- Marketing stuff?
- Working remote but only kind of?
- Next Rock?
	- Take concrete steps to getting to the higher company level
	- The sooner I crush development, the sooner people let me do other things
		- Sometimes it takes accomplishments. When jesse pulled off his first atomic con it made him feel better about being him. He could demonstrate value. 
	- Next Rock is back to basics again
		- Typescript
		- React
		- Webpack / Building out a site
		- GraphQL
		- AWS Solutions Architect
		- Redo of EvoAnima app
- Recharging

## Meeting [[2021-06-10]]
- [[Shawn Crowley]] and helping with in person vs remote
	- Goal is the blessing to punch time to talk more about this
- [[Getting Things Done by David Allen]]
- How hard would it be to get back into dev after leaving dev?
	- At this stage in my career, it would be challenging to get back into the industry at a solid pay. 5-10 years into my career this is easier. 
		- The marginal learning per year early on is quite high. 
- How hard would it be to get a Product Manager role? 
	- Hard at a startup because they either have someone or are super early on.
- Talking with [[Jason Porritt]] about [[202106091416 - There's an uneven distribution of knowledge on teams]] was super useful and I want to do more of this.
	- How do I get more conversations like this?
		- The newer you are in a company, the more adapted to the role you have to be. The older you are the more you get to adapt the role to you. 
			- This might be bad news. The organization might not have room for someone like me, for things that I like to do. 
		- Kind of like a Tech Lead as Jason has lots of these bigger conversations
			- Research of the big ideas helps me climb the mountain more quickly
				- Shift part of my reading towards coding discovery that builds up my basics. 
					- I might have been biased against computer science because of how boring my classes were. 
		- The answer might be to stay as a developer for X years and build more influence. 
	- [[I "back out" details by understanding the big picture first, not vice versa]] can help out with this. So bring this to work with me. 

## Meeting [[2021-06-03]]
- [[Punished by Rewards by Alfie Kohn]]
	- 
- Me taking your job
	- What does it look like? 
		- Seasonal
			- September through November is very busy. Lots of trying to talk to clubs and schools and doing career fairs. Tons of mock interviews.
				- Interviewing he does not like
					- Most of interviewing is saying no and concern spotting. We have 100 applicants for 4 positions (you say no 96%). 
				- Hiring can also be stressful because there is lots outside of your control
					- You are held accountable for people and things you can't control
			- Early summer / spring is busy because of new cohort.
			- Reflection is big
				- What can we do better next time around?
					- This type of question can be difficult because every cohort and member of each cohort is different. The goal is to create some sort of playbook. 
			- Being a manager is weird and it sucks
				- It exposes all of your faults
				- There is an easy chemistry with some people and sometimes it is just not there. 
					- Do you bring less of yourself to this person? Do you adapt to them? Do they adapt to you?
				- Being a mid level manager is even worse
					- People see you as a threat yet you also have little real power.
					- You constantly have to dig deeper because people don't tell you the full story.
					- Sometimes people feel you are representative of all the companies policies even if you disagree with them. You have to present the positive case. 
			- Different work than being a developer
				- Development is only about throughput - how much did you get done? 
					- Hard to argue with - very concrete. Objective and someone can say it's good. Not the case with accelerator manager job. Highly subjective. 
				- Being accelerator manager is more about saying the right thing in the right moment. 
					- You can destroy a whole year of good work in 5 minutes
					- Basically [[202104081532 - Value as a consultant is unevenly distributed]] on steroids
					- Makes it unclear what you have done in a day
					- Lots of critics because you have people from above and below and the side.
			- No Pair
				- All the stress and weight and no one to share it with. No one to bounce ideas off of. 
			- Atomic is a thing he feels confident selling. 
			- Favorite part is seeing the growth of people and what they do *after* the accelerator
			- Little training you can do to prepare for becoming a manager
				- Higher consequences for failure than being a developer
			- Lots of time to take on interesting initiatives (which is also stressful because [[Making decisions is hard]])
				- This is in part because of the [[03062021 - Levers]] that you get to pull because of the number of people you get to interact with. 
			- Lots of emotional work because you are people's first touch point for American corporate life. 
- RTO Stress
	- Lots of factors and lots of new [[03062021 - Levers]] to deal with. 
	- Basically I need to do more [[202106031023 - Function Stacking]]
		- Biking to work is function stacking - exercise plus getting to work
	- Be very clear with people about things.
		- Be consistent with people. So phone calls only on certain days after certain times. 
	- [[202105051633 - Finding bright spots motivates and directs change]] can be used to max out your satisfaction on a certain thing
		- Go bigger on the one thing you do have time for. 
	- Work habits and things in sequentially using [[Do 1 new habit at a time]] and [[Reward Myself for Meditating Daily & Monthly]]
		- Maybe writing is the season of the winter and it gives you something to look forward to. 
			- Maybe November is the month of reading and December is the month of writing or something. 
			- Maybe February is the month of [[Neil]] and Jimmy projects!
			- All based on [[202106031029 - It's not how much time an activity takes, it's how many things you are already doing]]
- Rock
- LA
	- Am I moving to LA? Or visiting?

## Meeting [[2021-05-27]]

- Rockford ride is mostly flat and relaxing
	- That said, if it's like Jason and Patrick and Adam on the ride, then it can get going pretty fast. 
- Professional Development
	- 2 hour long blocks a week
	- Could I co opt this and build it into my reading habit
		- Audio Book
		- Kindle Book
		- Work book
		- Physical book
	- Think about this in terms of [[Switch - How to Change Things When Change is Hard by Dan and Chip Heath]]
		- I have to figure out why this is worth doing and figure out the specific actions that get me the most benefit. 
			- Why do I need to learn the basics of SQL? 
				- Because I feel like Jason and others expect me to lead features and to do that I need to know the basics of SQL. 
					- Right now I'm using a terrible strategy, which is basically [[Punished by Rewards by Alfie Kohn]]. 
						- I'm direct the rider but not motivating the elephant ([[The Righteous Mind by Jonathon Haidt]])
					- Prof dev can feel like self-care (if done well)
				- The problem here is that I'm not particularly interested in leading a feature... 
				- Motivations
					- Incorporate it into my ideas
					- Builds credibility for my ideas so that people give me more influence
				- Have to feel like you are getting value and feeling like you are progressing
					- Make a plan
						- I have two problems, the elephant is not motivated and the path is not clear
							- Elephant can be motivated by making this about my ideas - it's part of what I do and a new source for ideas instead of working against it. 
							- Path can be cleared up by creating an end date, scheduling sessions to learn and writing down how I will do my work. 
					- GOAL: Finish SQL Book by the end of June. By doing 2 sessions per week. 

## Meeting [[2021-05-20]]

- Talk about conversation with [[Jordan Nelson]] and how to deal with passiveness getting in the way of growth
	- Talk about my experience vs [[Jason Porritt]]'s goal - why such a big gap?
		- Jason is more experienced & sees the long term nature of this. I'm freaked out because it's the first time and Jason is not because he's seen this a million times. 
	- talk about learning & Jordan
		- Be more direct with asks:
			- Driving
			- Breaks
			- Teaching
		- CPR is happening now
			- C is for an event you notice
			- P is a pattern 
			- R is relationship trouble
- Talk about how to deal with Matt...

Feedback
- Don't quite on VIM, get better at it on your own time
- Walking Blue during group discussions is not working
	- Coaching is more ok
	- Folks deserve max Jimmy and folks are not getting max Jimmy this way
- Not ramping in as fast as normal
	- Great accelerators have had this feedback before, not a crazy thing
		- Typically because communication is not working enough to get people what they need. 
	- This deserves my full attention and it matters to me
		- Double down on Prof Dev
			- SQL
			- VIM
			- Typescript
	- What if driving looks like I drive until Jordan gets frustrated with a thing and then I go and learn about it.

MISSION CRITICAL [[Switch - How to Change Things When Change is Hard by Dan and Chip Heath]].

UVP of Atomic as an Employer: 
- Our best value is the people and community at Atomic


Facts:
- [[03062021 - Levers]]:
	- Roughly at peak rate right now
	- Maxed out profit margin


Problems:
- Senior atoms aren't making the case for going back into the office
	- This means that it's not that valuable


Things we can't compete on:
- Salary
	- We can't offer tons of salary 
- Remote Work
	- We kind of die as a consultancy if we go remote
- Interesting work
	- We don't have the most interesting work ever

- Spin
- Break Culture
	- Especially for folks who are new to the company who need psychological safety to ask for breaks
	- Might be as simple as leading by example (doing it the way you think it should be done)
		- What is your vision for the end goal? Run this through the switch framework. 
			- Healthier & happier atomic object
				- Create humor and positivity
		- Brown bag topic
			- Find the bright spots
			- Come up with productive breaks
				- Take 15 minutes to come up with compliment for a coworkers
				- Take 15 minutes to come up with a dad joke
				- Take 5 minutes to do a BuddyMove workout
	- Write spin posts about timers
		- [[202105041057 - Timers decrease decision fatigue]] & [[Utilize timers to set boundaries for yourself and others]]
- Atomic Brain Trust
	- Slack plugin
		- Wraps up content and sends it to people to learn
	- Punch IT
		- Annotating it with tech stacks
			- Who is a subject matter expert
			- Areas for atomic to double down on
	- Spin Culture
		- NLP fun stuff on spin posts
	- AI Writing
		- People would be love this if they could have a bot that writes most of their post and they can just edit it. 
		- Tons of people have discomfort with the fact that spin is above and beyond. 
		- Slack plug in that auto suggests spin topics
			- Could be super simple - highest number of threads 
	- WIKI
		- Person focused
			- have people's hot takes on various tech
		- We have to focus on information that is so specific to Atomic that the internet can't do it for us
			- Wiki about react would not out perform stack overflow
		- Challenge is determining what type of content would be valuable
			- Onboarding esque would be the most valuable type of thing
- Outreach on business philosophy

## Meeting 04-23-2021

- Most people at [[Atomic Object]] are internally focused. There is definitely space for business development in an outward facing role that I could build towards. I like the idea of being an Ambassador for Atomic Object. 
- Be careful when addressing issues of creating disrespect. That is triggering and it's best to avoid unless necessary.
- When updating people, add why to your response so people don't have to wonder why you are prioritizing the way you are. Connected to [[202104161040 - Only gives commitments for things you can control]]. 
	- So in this case, I could have added why I had to wait (meeting with Jason) which would give him the chance to response based on priorities.

This is based on a conversation with [[Liv Panozzo]] about the pathology of my information consumption. She helped me get to the root of what was going on and help me create limits. I also remember hearing about [[202103261011 - Knowledge management depends on reads and writes]] and this is like a storage problem. I'm storing too much #Information in part because the cost is too low and in part because I'm obsessing over it to make my world safe. 

As part of this experiment, I want to change the type of information I consume. Liv asked me:
> Are you reading because you want to or because you have to? 

I want that question to guide me. I find that I'm often reading because I feel like I have to in order to keep up. I feel like I _must_ learn about #Cryptocurrency and other stuff because everyone else is. I don't want to chase trends because it's not fun and because I think it will hinder my creativity. Running where everyone else does is not going to lead to #Creativity.

#Experiment: Penalize myself $5 for every day I interrupt Liv

#Result: Canceled the commitment because it sucked. 

## Reflection
- It's better to create positive goals than negative ones. It's easier to do something than not do it. What I found was that if I failed early I was completely demoralized. There is no undoing. Whereas with the other habits I tried that were positive ([[Penalize Myself $5 for every day I didn't write]] & [[Penalize myself $5 for every day I didn't brush my teeth twice]]), I could "fix" them at any time and avoid the penalty, there was no fixing an interruption. These types of habits are better trained with rewards. 
- Also, this goal was unrealistic and unclear. Struggled to define an "interruption" - does bad cell signal count? Also, this is just very hard. What I found was that it took my focus off of the important thing - [[Liv Panozzo]] - and made me super #Stressed

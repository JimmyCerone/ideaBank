#Experiment: Penalize Myself $5 for every day I didn't write

#Result: Wrote for 70 days

## Reflection
- This worked and taught me a ton about #Writing. It won't work for every #Habit and it's not super sustainable. Best for short sprints. Not really for building habits now that I think about it. If something needs to get done though and it's short to medium term, this is a great option. 

## Connections
- A big part of the success of this habit was that I conformed to the #Idea of [[202103171233 - Add habits one at a time]]. I also used this concept when [[Penalize myself $5 for every day I didn't brush my teeth twice]], which was the inspiration for this experiment.

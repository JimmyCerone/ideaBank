#Experiment: Reward myself for meditating daily and monthly

#Result: 11 day streak (and counting)

## Reflection
- I find the daily motivation to be less useful than the bigger, monthly reward. I love the monthly reward so much that I want it to act as an anchor for #Monthly reflections via my #Daily #Journal. The reward for this #Habit is a subscription to hey.com! Cannot wait!
- I'm considering running and bed time as potential future habits and a Kindle as a future reward.

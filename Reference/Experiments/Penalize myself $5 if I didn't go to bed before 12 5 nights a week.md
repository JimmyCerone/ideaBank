#Experiment: Penalize myself $5 if I didn't go to bed before 12 5 nights a week

#Result: Faked the results because I failed so badly and didn't want to lose $. 

## Reflection
- Similar to [[Penalize myself $5 for every day I interrupt Liv]], this one had no goal. It was the absence of a goal. Now that I'm rethinking it, it would work super well with positive incentives. Might have to try something like [[Reward Myself for Meditating Daily & Monthly]] with this. 
- Also bad because there were so many #Variables out of my #Control. You don't always get to choose when you go to bed and some things are more important than bedtime.

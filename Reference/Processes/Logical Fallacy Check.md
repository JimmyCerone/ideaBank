Just noticing that I have ended up discovering lots of logical fallacies recently and wanted to start compiling them in one place. 

1. Something can be logical but wrong because it's based on an incorrect premise ([[202105211647 - Something can be logical but wrong]])
	- Faulty premise is often based on [[202104211317 - Inductive reasoning is often misused when addressing systemic problems]]
2. Something can be accurate but not true ([[202105211614 - Snapshots are accurate but not the truth]])

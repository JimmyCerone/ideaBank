## Why
- I realized the need for this kind of process when I got my [[Remarkable]] and started thinking about the [[Article First Approach]]. I realized that most of my life I've neglected articles as a source of knowledge, yet many articles are hugely influential (like [[As We May Think by Vannevar Bush]]). Plus, articles give me the chance to take a peek at a topic before I do a [[Deep Work by Cal Newport]] style dive into it. 
- So my goal in reading articles is twofold: 
	- Expose myself to new topics with a low time investment
	- Capture ideas in a more nearly [[The Atomic Web Note Taking Strategy - Zettelkasten]] form. 


## Current Progress as of [[2021-06-26]]
- Right now I'm doing great on the first goal, consistently reading articles. However, processing them seems to take too much time and I don't do it well. Putting it on my [[Getting Things Done/Getting Things Done]] board seems to be useful. Also, trying to stick to original ideas that I haven't heard before or those that I come up with myself have been helpful. I think that by adding the ideas on my phone to the obsidian ideas list on the getting things done board, I can make this happen. 

## Input Process
- Save to OneTab
- Check OneTab whenever I run out of good ones in [[Pocket]]

## Reading
- ~1 time a day find an article in [[Pocket]] and send it to my [[Remarkable]]
- At night ([[Bedtime Routine]]) read an article (or some other time)

## Processing
- Add a note to the [[Obsidian]] ideas list
- Get to the idea when I get to it

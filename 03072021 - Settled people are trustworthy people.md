## Context
- I have this #Concept of #Settled #People. They are deserving of #Trust. While reading [[The Wright Brothers by David]], I found that Wilbur seems to be one of these people and offers a good definition. 
- Another person I find that is settled in books comes from a #Fiction #Book we read at the #OregonExtension (where I also found more settled people, like Kevin). In [[Brothers Karamozov by Dostoyevsky]], Father Zosima is settled. 
- Jesus was a settled person, at least when read through the lens of John Eldridge. He consistently found third paths and was able to creatively come up with solutions to hard problems under pressure. 


## Idea
- I think settled people are "third path" people in the parlance of [[Beautiful Outlaw by John Eldridge]]. They are good at finding solutions that others miss. As is said about Wilbur, they are firm without being dictatorial and disagree without causing offense. 
- I find that a quality of settled people is that they give good advice that is not prescriptive.

> Alert, patient, closely attentive, Wilbur "never rattled," as his father would say, never lost his confidence. He could be firm without being dictatorial, disagree without causing offense. Nor was there ever a doubt that when we spoke he knew what he was talking about.

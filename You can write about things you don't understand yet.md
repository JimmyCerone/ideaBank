## Context
- I first came across this article in regards to Tim Ferris's article about fame [[11 Reasons Not to Become Famous - Tim Ferris]] in which he referenced this article by the original author [[Still Alive by Astral Codex Ten]]. 

## Reflection
- I am struggling with #Writing at the moment, as I've tried to both make it consistent (worked but felt oppressive) and let it flow (which resulted in little to no writing at all). In reading this story about this dude's intellectual progress, he talked about writing about things he didn't know. I think most of the time I tried to write as an #Expert, yet I'm not one. It could be incredibly freeing to write incomplete thoughts and wrestle with #Ideas live instead of presenting perfect thoughts. 
- Also fascinating to see what ideas he's wrestling with. How did he keep track of it all? 

## Action Item
- Publish some type of thing weekly about intellectual progress and ideas I'm struggling with.

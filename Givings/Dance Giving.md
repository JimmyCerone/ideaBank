You can give specifically to:

- H2
- International 
- Building Project

## Questions
- What would make the most impact?
	- H2 (Ticket sales based - not funded by the college)
		- 86100
		- Only goes to H2 specifically
		- Striketime is already supported by an endowment
	- International Travel Fund
		- 25896
		- Well funded at the moment
		- Can only be used on international travel
	- Discretionary Fund (25995)
		- Can go anywhere in the dance department
		- Called a restricted fund. If that number is put into the portal, it goes directly to the fund. 
		- This would plug holes which is very useful around this time

Two types of funds: 
- Restricted
	- Specific donor gifts given to a department. 
	- The donor expresses the college cannot use it except what the college says to use it for
- Nonrestricted
	- Come from the school based on revenue
	- Distributed amongst the various programs on campus
	- The college at any point can redistribute these funds away

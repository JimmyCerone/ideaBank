## Reflections
- This is kind of an idea I had while thinking about [[202104191339 - Free trials flip the switch from choosing to buy to remembering to quit]]. There seem to be a couple [[03062021 - Levers]] that the #Internet pulled to make this a thing: 
	- Lowered the cost of distribution to basically 0
	- Vastly increased the potential audience

- What's cool about the internet is that it pulled both levers. If you'd only pulled the first lever you'd still have to charge because you couldn't pull enough ads or churn through enough users to justify a conversion rate. But since the # of people was high and the distribution costs were low, this works. 

- Old time markets or farmers markets are an example of low distribution cost with small audience. It's an oversimplification of course because their marginal costs are above 0 (whereas software is 0). 


## Connections
- Very unsure about how this connects to [[202103291338 - Free market leads to monopoly]] and other #Capitalism ideas. Kind of fascinated. Definitely relates to the decision made in #Tech to [[202104191456 - The early internet chose ad based instead of subscription based]]. 

## Questions
- Was the "free" model around before the #Internet? Where and how?

## Idea
- The implications of autonomous cars are basically the same as public transport, with one major [[03062021 - Levers]] that differ: specificity of location. 
	- All the rest seems the same. You get in and you are taken somewhere. What would it mean if that were multiplied?  

## Connections
- Not sure what this connects to as it seems novel and in a different field than I normally ideate.

## Example
- [[Google]]'s  bus system is effectively a "self-driving" car in the sense that the [[03062021 - Levers]] positions are very similar.

There are all kinds of wild #Innovation out there right now that few know about. This is a sub set of [[202104070847 - Founders can choose product quality or distribution]]. There are tons of great products out there with little to no #Distribution and thus we don't know about them. 

What's interesting is how this connects to [[The Wright Brothers by David]] and the idea that [[03062021 - Small obscure journals can be a fertile source of the early jump]]. Further, this gives a little hope to the [[202103261112 - The future is inherently unpredictable]]. It's unpredictable yes, but you can pull on [[03062021 - Levers]] to increase the predictability. The challenge is then finding good sources of #Information before other people. That is more of a human problem, in that [[202103261111 - Humans are terrible predictors]]. What's a bummer is that the information is likely out there and even if we had it, we couldn't predict well based on it. Would this be a good use case of [[AI]]?

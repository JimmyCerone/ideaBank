## Context
- Thinking of this #Idea in light of the fact that [[King Leopold's Ghost]] never visited the Congo yet rained down so much blood there. Wild. Unfortunately, most maniacs understand the power of #Levers and use them to do much of their dirty work. 
	- It's almost as if the #Trauma of one individual is getting worked out at a larger scale, with terrible consequences. Hurt people use others to work out their trauma. Reminds me of [[Waking the Tiger]]. 

## Quote
> Monsters exist, wrote Primo Levi of his experience at Aushwitz. "But they are far too few in number to be truly dangerous. More dangerous are...the functionaries ready to believe and to act without asking questions"
- Curious what [[The Righteous Mind by Jonathon Haidt]] - how do we avoid this phenomenon? [[Nudge by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein]]? Is it through the little things? Also, the quote reminds me of #Trump and #QAnon. 
> Just as terrorizing people is part of conquest, so is forcing someone else to administer the terror.

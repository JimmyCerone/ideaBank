## Reflections
- Lots of interesting implications here, though I'm not sure of everything. Certainly interesting connections with [[03-03-2021 - Our language creates our reality]] and [[03072021 - In oral history, if you think it's true, it's true]]. Basically a specific example of [[202104222140 - Data is a reflection of our history]]. What's interesting is that you can analyze it like history and search it like a search engine ([[Search engines cast too wide a net]]) according to [[Psionica]].

## Reflections
- [[2021-04-16]] I was running a data load and said it would be done by a precise time. I could not control the speed of the process and it ran long.

## Connections
- [[03-03-2021 - Our language creates our reality]] plays big here, as well as [[Crucial Conversations by Patterson and Company]]. You have to be careful to commit to what you can control - like giving an update (instead of saying something will be done by X time)

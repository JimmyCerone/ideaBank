## Reflections
- Found this article fascinating because it would be super applicable for [[Neil]] and I's work.
- The design principles aim to be broad, yet give you the ability to make day to day decisions as well. 
- While I hate Facebook, their design principles are a perfect example: 
	> [Facebook's design principles](http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=118951047792&ref=mf):
	>    Universal: our design needs to work for everyone, every culture, every language, every device, every stage of life.
	>    Human: our voice and visual style stay in the background, behind people’s voices, people’s faces, and people’s expression.
	>    Clean: our visual style is clean and understated.
	>    Consistent: reduce, reuse, don’t redesign.
	>    Useful: meant for repeated daily use
	>    Fast: faster experiences are more efficient and feel more effortless.
	>    Transparent: we are clear and up front about what’s happening and why.

## Questions
- How often do we at Atomic create these principles and how often do the companies we work with already have them?

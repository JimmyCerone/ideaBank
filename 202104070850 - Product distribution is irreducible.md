I think this is the main reason that [[202104070847 - Founders can choose product quality or distribution]]. This is what makes distribution hard, it's a #Complex #System. It is like [[Obsidian]] in that it is #Network and cannot be isolated. 

When thinking that way, building a #SocialNetwork is very hard. 

## Example
- This is why building out a network during my time at #Colorado was so dang hard. 


## Connections
- Kind of a counter example to Ray Dalio's idea from [[Principles by Ray Dalio]] that [[03062021 - Solving a problem in independent parts, making uncorrelated bets, leads to success]]. In a social network, this would be a wasteful and very hard strategy, I think. Or maybe it would be very cool. No idea... Huh.

## Idea
The [[03062021 - Levers]] involved in time management are: 
- The number of activities
- The time required for each activity
- The switching cost of activities

We often think only of the time required without accounting for the other costs. 
## Connections
- We make these mistakes because [[202103261111 - Humans are terrible predictors]] and [[202104300005 - Humans can't multitask]]

## Example
- The closer your hard disk gets to max capacity, the worse it's performance gets.

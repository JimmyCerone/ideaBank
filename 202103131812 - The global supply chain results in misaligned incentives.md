In [[The Elephant and the Dragon by Robyn Meredith]], the author talks about the disassembly line as the next great #Industrial #Revolutions. The #Problem with this new way of doing things is that since each action is #Atomic and uncorrelated (like [[Principles by Ray Dalio]]), the interests of unrelated areas drive actions. This means that it's in the corporations best interest to plunder an area (since there are many more areas), even as that's an #Unsustainable #Strategy for the area. What appears to be #Efficiency, [[03062021 - Solving a problem in independent parts, making uncorrelated bets, leads to success]], can actually lead to terrible outcomes. In [[King Leopold's Ghost]], the local areas were decimated both in terms of people and in terms of rubber ([[202103131802 - Rubber changed the world]]). It reminds me of #AtomicObject's #Budgeting process. If you assume that everything will go well and that all incentives are aligned, you are preparing yourself for massive #Risk. The incentives are especially misaligned when [[202103131751 - Power imbalances attract those who seek control]]... 

## Connections
- What could this mean in light of [[03-04-2021 - Unbundling your phone into separate functions]]? Are there hidden downsides to that? 
- I think books like [[The Hidden Life of Trees]] pose interesting alternatives to current #Systems. [[Seaton]] talks about #Permaculture as well and how things can synergistically outproduce what you'd expect. 
- I have to wonder if this is more recognized than I think. Could this actually be an intended outcome of our current system if the theory that [[03062021 - Business is a war that not everyone is cut out for]] is true? 
- This is kind of a corollary to [[202103131701 - Evil causes most of its harm indirectly]]. The intention may not be to destroy local #Community, but the incentives are setup to do so. And we know how that ends thanks to [[Nudge by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein]].

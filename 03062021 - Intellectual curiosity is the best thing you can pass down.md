## Context
- The Wright Brothers challenged many of the #Ideas of the day about flying because they were able to think differently about #Problems. The difference was that they were #Curious and didn't accept traditional answers. 
- Their curiosity was not mirrored by the US Government. They doubted their achievements, as did major news outlets ([[03062021 - Small obscure journals can be a fertile source of the early jump]]). Thus foreign governments got the jump on the US, just as tap was first popular in Europe ([[Shoot Me While I'm Happy - Memories from the Tap Goddess of the Lower East Side by Jane Goldberg]])

## Reflection
- The hardest part about encouraging intellectual curiosity in others is that you must be willing to question your own ideas and rethink them. That's the hardest part, deconstruction as it's very destabilizing. In some ways, this reminds me of the fact that [[Shared realities with different interpretations]]. Being curious opens yourself to dealing with the implications of the reality of others. It requires asking [[How do you see the world]] to others and being committed to listening to their response.

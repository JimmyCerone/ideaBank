## Idea
- To reward something, you have to know what you are looking for and since [[202103261112 - The future is inherently unpredictable]] and [[202103261111 - Humans are terrible predictors]], we end up in a situation where rewards cannot encourage creativity because creativity is based on inventing new things. 


## Connections
- [[Rewards decrease the long term intrinsic value of the behavior you are rewarding]] plays off this in a terrible combination of [[03062021 - Levers]] because by attempting to reward creativity (which isn't possible), you are decreasing the intrinsic desire for creative activities
- [[202103292312 - Risk can be measured by degrees of freedom]] and so can creativity. Rewards are all about minimizing the degrees of freedom (at least with dog training) to be super specific. 

## Example
- Rewarding innovation in the patent system ([[The Case for Abolishing Patents (Yes, All of Them) by Jordan Weissmann]])

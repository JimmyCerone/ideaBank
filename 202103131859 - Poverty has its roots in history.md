I think in many circles, #Poor is a character trait, likely in part because of [[03132021 - The gospel of enterprise has been used for centuries to demean outsiders]]. However, in my experience reading, #Poverty seems to be more #History than anything else. Since [[03-03-2021 - Our language creates our reality]], I think this is an important distinction to make and I'm curious as to why the distinction isn't made more often in our #Politics. I'm sure it has something to do with [[The Righteous Mind by Jonathon Haidt]] and groups and #Tribes. The idea that [[03-04-2021 - False perceptions of other's perceptions of you can trap you]] is hard for me to grasp and I think it applies here.

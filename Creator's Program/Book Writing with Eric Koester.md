#Problem: Finishing a book is super hard.

Eric's theory is that the reason it's so hard is that people try to do it alone, when the best books are written in community. 

Second-time authors do things differently. They end up writing waaay more books because they know how. Writing your first book is way harder. 

What Second Time #Authors Do: 

- Don't worry about book structures
- Learn first
- Have & use templates
- Group of fellow others
- Editing Support early on
- Focus on finishing a first draft, not the finished thing
- They have dates/targets


A #Book only take like 5 months once you know the process, a year total. 

Goals:

- 1 hour meeting. 2-4 hours writing outside of this.
- Bi-weekly Library Sessions
- 20 weeks
- Targets along the way
- Coach / instruction
- Editing / Feedback throughout
- 25,000 words or so

Cost: 
- Dues go to the development editor

Definition of a #Book is a bunch of small stories tied together. 
	- for nonfiction, 70-80% of your stuff is stories.
	- Goal is to write a bunch of small things and then bam - you've got a book
	- 35 stories at about 750 words a story in a nonfiction book
	
	
#Levers of Book Writing:
- You can write 1 book or 35 stories.

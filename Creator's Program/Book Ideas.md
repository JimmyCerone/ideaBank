# Michele Kaufman's Book
Book Concept: #Mentorship and #ReverseMentorship

I love the thread of reverse mentorship. Seems super interesting. 

People pay to be part of an organization to find a mentor. That's not how it went for her and she wants people to have that built in, without having to pay. Advertising vs story. Paid mentorship is like an ad, not in context. 

Working Title: 
- Refinding Mentorship in the age of commodities
- Mentoring, backwards and forwards
- Rehumanizing mentorship

# Cass Lauer's Book
Fiction writer.

Main Idea: Blog of Dictionary of Obscure sorrows.

Man creates words for things that don't exist out of existing roots. They are all etymogically correct. 

The plot is a backstory to that blog plus a book and dictionary. A young copy writer finds the book.

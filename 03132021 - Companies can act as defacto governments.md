## Context
- Came across this idea while reading [[King Leopold's Ghost]]. 

## Example
- King Leopold copied an existing concept, with the Dutch king, who established a #Money trading concession with the West Indies. 
	- Leopold did the same with the Congo, creating a company with a majority stake owned by him. The #Companies he owned hired soldiers and acted as a militaristic #Government. This allowed Leopold to escape the oversight of his own government where his power as a #King was shrinking because of the transition to a #Parliamentary setup. 
	- Leopold further used #Legal arguments to make the case that his companies could act as governments to setup treaties with local chiefs. 
		- Very similar to what Americans did in [[The Heart of Everything That Is]]. Happened just after Red Cloud's War in the 1880's
	- Leopold's use of many shell companies is remniscent of [[Titan The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.]], where Rockefeller used the companies to avoid claims of #Monopoly. 
		- Interesting that monopoly was to be avoided and free trade encouraged in this time and later the reverse was true, at least in the case of AT&T in the [[The Idea Factory]]. 
- One could argue that #Google and #Facebook are government like in their power today. Looking at all the #Revolutions and suppression that have taken place on their platform, they certainly have the influence of governments except for the fact they area #Multinational which is weird...

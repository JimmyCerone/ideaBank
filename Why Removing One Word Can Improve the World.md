### Why Removing One Word Can Improve the World

#### One word is hurting us badly. This is the time to let it go.

I keep hearing this word, in myself and online.

I hear it used to talk about the media, the conservatives, the immigrants.

I hear it used to divide us into warring camps, each side throwing sharp words across the chasm.

I hear it used to hurt all sides.

Those that use it and those that feel it’s sharp sting.

I think it’s time for us to let this word go.

The word, of course, is they.

#They are bad.

They are the problem.

No word creates distance like they.

We see they in our politics, in our relationships, even in ourselves.

They keeps us away from the scary parts of the world, from the scary parts of ourselves. Melinda Gates says it well in her book, [Moment of Lift](https://www.alibris.com/The-Moment-of-Lift-How-Empowering-Women-Changes-the-World-Melinda-Gates/book/42320797?matches=131):

> We tend to push out the people who have qualities we’re most afraid we will find in ourselves — and sometimes we falsely ascribe qualities we disown to certain groups, then push those groups out as a way of denying those traits in ourselves.

In short, they seems to keep us safe by keeping the “bad” things away.

Yet no word keeps our humanity away like the word they, either.

We see they in the worst tragedies the world has seen . They becomes a formless enemy whose humanity fades away as we wage a “holy” war.

They makes us feel okay, because they are bad, not us.

Yet numbing our conscience by naming them bad only wears away our humanity.

For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

They dehumanizes the other, but it also dehumanizes us.

As it’s said, you reap what you sow.

Once again, #MelindaGates comes to mind. In [[Moment of Lift]], Gates captures the problem of they elegantly:

> An abusive culture, to me, is any culture that needs to single out and exclude a group. It’s always a less productive culture because the organization’s energy is diverted from lifting people up to keeping people down. It’s like an autoimmune disease, where the body sees its own organs as threats and begins attacking them.

When we attack “they”, we attack ourselves. We are all deeply connected, just as our eyes are deeply connected to our feet.

All this leaves us with troubling questions: What are we doing to ourselves? What are we doing to they?

What if we took a moment to listen to the other side, not to the words they are saying, but to their unspoken pain?

What if we took a moment to listen to the other in us, that part of us we never acknowledge?

Today’s challenges need everyone, both us and them. We can no longer point fingers. That folks, is a simple fix.

We need to grapple with the reality that we are all stuck here with each other (though the aliens are coming).

No amount of prejudice, entitlement, or hatred can change the fact we need each other.

Now more than ever we know that.

Liberals need conservatives. Oil companies need the seas they spoil. Wise elders need young upstarts.

And as we’ve all discovered, we all need grocery store workers (who, we can all agree, need a raise).

We need this whole mess of a world, believe it or not. We need each other. We need every part of ourselves.

The sad reality is that in they, we separate ourselves.

We separate ourselves from each other and even our own selves.

So, let’s stop pointing fingers for a moment.

Let’s look deep inside.

And let’s forget about they for a moment.

**Let’s ask: Who are we? Are we who we want to be?**

Then, let’s cut they out (the word, not the people).

We are better than binaries folks.

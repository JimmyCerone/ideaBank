What's fascinating about this is that it's already happening, [[04082021 - Anarchy]] is already here. [[202104070856 - The future is already here, it's just not evenly distributed]]. We see user own networks in [[04082021 - Decentralized Autonomous Organizations]] like #Bitcoin and #Ethereum. 

## Implications
- There are a few interesting implications here. First, Politicians will hop on this. I highly doubt the old system will fade away. What's more likely is the old system will adopt this new one. 
- That said, there are going to be more cases of user owned, truly #Democratic services and #Government s. These new structures will apply to #Equity and #Government. 
- There will be lower switching costs between #Currency, #SocialNetwork, and #Government / #Nation 
- Negative externalities can't be controlled. From the article:

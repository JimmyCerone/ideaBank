## Idea
- Theology is only theology when it is aligned with the oppressed. This idea went against everything I grew up learning about and still has me thinking. Not sure what it looks like in my own life. Still working on that. 

## Example
- Health & Wealth != Theology

> In an effort to dissipate the slave's passionate desire for freedom, white missionaries sought to interpret the meaning of Christianity in the light of a futuristic eschatology, trying to convince the slave that the Christian gospel was concerned with pietistic moralities in this life as a means of gaining eternal life upon death. Thus Christianity was supposed to be concerned with the other world, what Nietzsche calledÂ "the illusion of worlds-behind-the-scene."

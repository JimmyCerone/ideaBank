## Idea
- Very reminiscent of [[Nudge by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein]]. I've always believed firmly in this, even as others have questioned it. Might even become one of my principles a la [[Principles by Ray Dalio]]. Surprised he didn't talk about it - he was much the opposite with a focus on changing people over culture. 

## Example
- [[Dopesick by Beth Macy]] is like a whole book about this concept.

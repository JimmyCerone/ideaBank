The Smart #Phone and #SocialMedia have distinct downsides. Same with the #Nuclear #Bomb. 

## Examples
- [[Dopesick by Beth Macy]] gave me striking new examples in terms of phone and encryption. [[Cryptocurrency is an abject disaster by Drew Devault]] talks about the downsides of crypto, which has been used in tons of criminal activity. 
	- The challenge with many of these things is that [[202104222244 - Structures with improper incentives will be abused]]. What's tough is how do we reconcile all this with [[202105081828 - Data privacy is not important because you have things to hide but because you will be taken advantage of]]. Seems like the best way to do that is regulate how data is used, but allow it to be used. Limited privacy with lots of protections.

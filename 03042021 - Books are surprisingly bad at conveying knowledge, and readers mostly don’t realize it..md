## Reflections
- This is a troubling realization that I'm just coming to. It's deeply connect to the idea that came from #Reading [[The Righteous Mind by Jonathon Haidt]], that we aren't #Rational. This is like an add on to that problem, even if I did read all the #Books in the world, I wouldn't retain very much. 
- All this reminds me of the need for #Remnote or a similar system with #SpacedRepition and #ActiveRecall. Those systems sound so time intensive to build, though... 


## Questions
- How do I figure out what is even worth remembering?

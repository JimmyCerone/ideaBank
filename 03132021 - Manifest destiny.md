## Context
- I was originally taught this in the context of #American #History and saw the nasty underbelly of it when reading [[The Heart of Everything That Is]] and visiting the #Lakota reservation while at #Hope. However, while reading [[King Leopold's Ghost]], I found that the same mentality and thinking was true of #Africa. Further, while reading [[The Elephant and the Dragon by Robyn Meredith]], I found that #China uses the same thinking when it comes to #Taiwan and I'm guessing #Tibet. 

## Connections
- This idea is closely related with the idea of the #NobleSavage, an odd #Romanticization of the same people who are being #Dehumanizing.  
- Interesting that manifest destiny is largely considered about territory and goods when [[03132021 - Colonialism imported ideas as well as goods]]. 
- Manifest destiny used the strategy of [[03132021 - One of the best ways to hide your villainy is to create another villain]]. They created villains out of the locals by claiming they wasted their land, which is deeply related to the [[03132021 - The gospel of enterprise has been used for centuries to demean outsiders]]. 
- This is one of those ideas that I think was better left uninvented, [[03102021 - Some inventions are better left uninvented]]. Just as things are better left undone, some #Ideas are better left unexpressed. 

## Questions
- When and why did this concept first come into being?

## Reflections
- Still don't understand this super well but the gist is that big conglomerates that don't have tight focus are on their way out because of the fierce competition of todays global market. [[The Elephant and the Dragon by Robyn Meredith]] and [[Cheap - The High Cost of Discount Culture]] kind of circle around this idea without mentioning it. 

## Examples
- The authors basically argue for a return of companies like [[The Idea Factory]] and [[Titan The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.]].

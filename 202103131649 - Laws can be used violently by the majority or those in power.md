- I think I've often considered laws to be fair and #Just, yet when a #Power imbalance exists, #Laws can often be used to oppress. There is a myriad of examples, but a few come to mind. 
- In most cases, the law is used to #Protect those already in power, often the #Government. 
	- The #Problem is that if the government is corrupt, then the whole system is. Think of the #Mob... 

## Examples
- In [[King Leopold's Ghost]], Leopold tricked chiefs into signing exclusive trading agreements. 
	- Further, when pressure forced him to enact #Reform, he #Scapegoated a few people in trails then used the [[03132021 - The gospel of enterprise has been used for centuries to demean outsiders]] idea to get people off easy. Justified use of force because natives were "lazy"
- The US Government tricked #Lakota into signing lopsided #Treaties (or just didn't follow them) in [[The Heart of Everything That Is]]. 
- Record executives tricked people in Motown (and many other places) into signing contracts that greatly undervalued the #Art and stole #Money from the artists.

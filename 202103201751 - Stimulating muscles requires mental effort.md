## Context
- I came across this idea while reading [[How Bad Do You Want It? by Matt Fitzgerald]] and it blew my mind.

## Idea
- The implications of this idea are huge. It means that the limits of endurance athletes are entirely mental, which is why the fact that [[202103201743 - Coping skills can be developed]] is so important. You can become a better runner by improving your mind. 

## Example
- Someone using a prosthetic arm becomes fatigued. This suggests that we tire not because our muscles tire, but because our brains do. A further study that had people solve tough math issues before running showed they ran worse afterwards, showing that brain fatigue inhibits performance.

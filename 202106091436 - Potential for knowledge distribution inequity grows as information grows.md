## Idea
- The bigger the project the faster it changes and the faster that [[202106091416 - There's an uneven distribution of knowledge on teams]] becomes a problem. Thus, even though [[03092021 - Knowledge is only useless when you can't retrieve it]], it's more useless when you don't have it because [[202106091445 - Reads and writes are not always done by the same person]]. You can't simply assumed that everyone knows what every write is (which would make reads redundant and wasteful). In this system, each read has more utility than each write has cost. 

## Connections

## Example
- [[Fusion Improvements]] gets out of date fast if we aren't careful because of the momentum of the project.

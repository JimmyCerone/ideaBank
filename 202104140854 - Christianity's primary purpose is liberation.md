## Reflections
- This is a definition of #Christianity I can finally get behind. I've spent so long hating the personal morality and the emphasis on small details and a far off heaven of the #Church I grew up in and it was refreshing to hear of a vision of a bold, action oriented church. 
## Connections
- [[202103131919 - Christianity and capitalism are deeply intertwined]] and this is also a real problem. The goal of #Capitalism is only sometimes liberation, so why does the church stand by it so wholeheartedly? We must repent.

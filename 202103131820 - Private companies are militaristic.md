- I would rather this not be true, but based on what happened in [[King Leopold's Ghost]], Wilbur's claim in [[The Wright Brothers by David]] - [[03062021 - Business is a war that not everyone is cut out for]], and the whole of [[Titan The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.]] (where #Oil #Companies suppressed workers with militias), I do believe it might be true. Now the #War seems to be fought differently, with #Laws doing the work. Connects directly with [[202103131649 - Laws can be used violently by the majority or those in power]]

## Ideas
- I'm not convinced that #Innovation is an unqualified positive for the world. I think it can go very badly, as it did in the case of the #Nuclear #Bomb. I'm with Thomas Merton and others in saying that the nuclear bomb is not good for the earth. I think that #Inventor s have a #Responsibility to invent things that are worth inventing and to understand the #Risks inherent in their creations. 
- Some would argue that invention is inevitable, and maybe that's true. There is credence to the fact that the same #Idea is stumbled upon by multiple people because it is in the adjacent possible. Yet, I'd still argue that unless you can control the application (hard to do), it's best to leave a stone unturned. 

## Connections
- [[Superintelligence]] is an interesting example of a careful consideration of the risks of an invention, in this case #AI. 
- In [[The Wright Brothers by David]], Orville says the following of the #Plane: 
 > I feel about the airplane much the same as I do in regard to fire. That is I regret all the terrible damage caused by fire, but I think it is good for the human race that someone discovered how to start fires and that we have learned how to put fire to thousands of important uses. 
 - This feels like a false equivalence. We didn't invent fire. It was already there. It dodges the issue. 
- In my thinking, I'm almost Amish. I've heard that they don't dislike #Technology, but are careful to use what is beneficial. [[03102021 - Not all tech is helpful]].

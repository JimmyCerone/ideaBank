## Idea
- When things get weird, we often nit pick, sticking to our basic assumptions. In essence, we fall into [[202104211317 - Inductive reasoning is often misused when addressing systemic problems]], using our previous experience instead of reasoning from first principles. 


## Example
- When debugging, I often assume that the code I wrote is the culprit instead of carefully investigating the assumptions made by the previous writers of the code. That said, sometimes I also scapegoat the system and don't check my own code. Gotta be a pattern in there somewhere.

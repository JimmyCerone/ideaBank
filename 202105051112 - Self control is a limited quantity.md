## Reflections
- Almost a corollary of [[202105051320 - Change is hard because people wear themselves out]]. What we find here is what [[Tim Ferriss]] talks about, minimizing the number of decisions you have to make. [[202105041057 - Timers decrease decision fatigue]] is in part because of this fact, that we only have so much energy to keep ourselves on top of things. Kind of goes deeper into my idea that [[202105051703 - We aren't limited by time we are limited by energy]]. We can only do so much hard, driven work. It's hard to recognize but there is friction in our minds, [[202103201751 - Stimulating muscles requires mental effort]] is real and our brain is a big muscles. 
There is a [[03062021 - Levers]] in here somewhere in this equation: 
\# of decisions X difficulty = energy used

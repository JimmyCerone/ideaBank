Right now there are a jumble of different jurisdictions surrounding #Gun #Laws so even if you have strict laws in one state, you can go and get guns easily in another. 

What I'm unsure of is where these laws would land in [[202104060852 - Enumerate vs reserved powers]]. There are already laws about interstate gun sales (I think?) but would do the [[202104060850 - Enumerated powers]] allow this? Is this covered in a "well regulated militia"?

## Context
- Realized this when talking with [[Aaron Reider]]. 

## Reflections
- I realized that when I talk with [[Liv Panozzo]], I talk at her and not with her. She is much more receptive to hearing my #Ideas when she can participate in some way. Practice asking her opinion about different things I'm learning.

## Context
- This idea originally comes from [[Rework]], but surfaced again in [[The Wright Brothers by David]]. The brothers did all their own mechanical work as [[03072021 - Do something yourself if it's important no matter if it's inefficient]]. Basically they lost #Efficiency in the short run but gained it in the long run by catching #Error s. 

## Idea
- The same principle holds from Rework. By doing a job yourself before hiring, it is less efficient in the short run. However, you have a better idea of what to hire for, so it's better in the long run.

## Context
- While reading [[Mating in Captivity by Esther Perelle]] and learning about how she used #Physical touch to visualize the #Emotion  distance between couples, I realized that the #Book itself I was reading was a visual representation of the #Idea. 

## Idea
- Books are one of the many possible representations of #Ideas. Verbal ways are also a type of #Visualizaton  - maybe the better word here is representation?

## Reflection
- I've been resonating deeply with this concept of visualization recently, which is a key theme of [[March 20, 2021]]. I get this weird feeling that it will be a bedrock of my life from here on out. Finding new ways to see the world by reconfiguring what is already out there. 
	- What if we don't need more new knowledge, but new ways to see that which we already know? Is that the point of meditation?

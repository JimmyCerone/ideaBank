This idea reminds me of [[202103131812 - The global supply chain results in misaligned incentives]]. It seems to me like outsiders rarely understand the #System at work, though sometimes they can have surprising insights. I see this idea at work in the idea [[202103131859 - Poverty has its roots in history]]. Most believe it's an individual problem, in part because of [[03132021 - The gospel of enterprise has been used for centuries to demean outsiders]]. But another part of it is that we are bad at understand systems and particularly bad at getting to root causes. I believe that using [[03062021 - Levers]] would improve the situation and perhaps help people find common ground. 

## Connections
- Part of the challenge of understanding the #Problems of others is that [[03-03-2021 - Our language creates our reality]]. Outsiders and insiders often have different languages and thus different realities. Understanding of another's reality [[03-04-2021 - False perceptions can't be cured by logical argument nor by manipulation]]. You must experience another's reality, which is hard to do. We are limited by [[03042021 - Books are surprisingly bad at conveying knowledge, and readers mostly donâ€™t realize it.]] In the #West, to learn we often turn to #Books. Yet those don't help us understand reality. 
- There's an insider problem here as well, if the outsider sees things effectively. [[03062021 - New inventions are almost always contested by traditionalists]]. Plus, [[03062021 - Innovators often look crazy until their ideas come to fruition]]. This combination makes it hard to make inroads if you do have an effective solution and it makes it hard to learn because there is no #Trust. 
- Often outsiders ignore the reality that [[03102021 - Not all tech is helpful]]. This leads to solutions that don't make sense. 
- I think the [[Will to Meaning vs Pleasure]] is at play here as well. In my experience, outsiders often assume something is done for pleasure, is frivolous if they don't understand it. Reading [[Cows, Pigs, Wars, and Witches - The Riddles of Culture by Marvin Harris]] made me reconsider my #Assumptions in this area. 

## Context
- When coming to the Congo in [[King Leopold's Ghost]], missionaries expected to try to eradicate #Polygamy and instill #Christianity. Instead, they were witness to a #Genocide and were unprepared to help. I found it fascinating how misaligned the incentives were between the missionaries and the #Indigenous people because of their insider outsiders statuses. In an interesting twist, the missionaries adapted and many became critiques of the regime, though Leopold pushed them down because [[03072021 - Fake news has been around forever (not a new phenomenon)]]. In this case, King Leopold held most of the [[03062021 - Levers]] since he was still in #Europe and experienced in #Politics

#Problem: Budgeting apps make you spend more

## [[03062021 - Levers]]
- Time frame
	- The longer the time frame the less effective the budget because you end up spending up to your limit
- Budget category breadth
	- Narrow categories encourage the idea that you can shuffle spending around and be "ok". This is rarely the case. 

## Solutions
- Budget over shorter time frame and broaden category

## Reflections
- If you have more income than you need or you are generally disciplined / delay purchases
	- How do budgets connect to [[Punished by Rewards by Alfie Kohn]]? Is this part of why they are so popular? Why does something so ineffective across many outcomes, stay so popular? 
		- People don't stick to budgets
		- If they do stick to a budget they are probably spending more. 
			- Budgets seem to work best for the short term. 


## Questions
- What if we are looking at budgets wrong? 
	- What if instead of exercise where you do it daily, budgets are medicine you take when you are financially sick? What if you have a financial dashboard like Personal Capital that is your vitamin?
		- The main use day to day is to help you visualize your money, though we aren't even that good at that for the same reason we aren't good at scheduling ([[Why two Clockwise designers built a video game that gives humans empathy for machines by Cathy Reisenwitz]])

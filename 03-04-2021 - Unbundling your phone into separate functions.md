Author is the one and only [[Brian Helfman]].

## Idea
- #Phone s are 'bundled' in that they have distracting "fun" apps, productivity #App s, and meditation apps all on one device. This is part of what makes them so distracting. It's like #RemoteWork / Working from Home.

## Questions
- Could I do this with my old / retired iPhones over time? Just build up old phones that have dedicated purposes? Can I do this with software going out of style so quickly?


## Action Items
- Strongly considering buying a Kindle to break out my reading. 
	- I can even get Pocket articles on there: https://help.getpocket.com/article/1127-using-pocket-on-kindle-devices

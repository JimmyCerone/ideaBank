| :----------: | :----------: | :----------: | :----------: | :----------: |
| Convo with Elaine | | | Y | Go in soft to hard conversations |
| Broke my DB | | | Y| Need to compile JS before running migrations|
| Got completely off track and confused at #Work | | Y | | I'm not sure how it happened. Gotta traige this|
| Freaked out when I wasn't productive at #Work | | Y | | I think this is #RemoteWork. I wouldn't be stuck half as much irl |
| I blame Blue for my lack of #Productivity | | Y | | I would still feel like I didn't do enough without Blue |
| Taught #Blue he gets rewarded for barking instead of for being quiet | | | Y | I can't give him a treat right after he barks, but waay before or after |
| Took Liv's words personally and was defensive | Y | | | In the future, it's best to avoid late night intense conversations |
| Took Liv's words about Blue not being alone badly and was defensive & condescending | | Y | | I can leave space between her words and mine to see what she's feeling before speaking | 
| Failed to pay attention while Meredith worked & was left clueless the next morning as I picked up her work | | Y | | Not sure how to fix this... But a consistent problem | 
| Did not leave Blue alone before he went to Liv's | | Y | | I let my optimism allow me to ignore problems. There are plenty of ways I could have worked on this, but chose to ignore it |
| Failed to bring up that I didn't want move the direction we were going at work | | Y | |  Need to bring up discomfort with project direction |
| Taking an opportunity because it's too good to pass up | | Y | | |
| Dropped computer in the snow while walking Ivy | Y | | | It's best to pause a meeting and switch to a phone (even if it breaks the norms) than try and fail to do something else |
| Failed to go to bed at a decent hour last night | | Y | | I get into this mode where I saw I deserve the relaxation time. That's fair, but probably just means I need relax more and do less after work. Going to try to do non work stuff before work 8-8:30. |
| Waited to ask for help past the time I knew I needed it at work | | Y | | I hate asking for help, so I'm trying to work on decreasing the amount of time between my struggle and my ask for help |
| Stayed up till 4 watching arrow in part because I overscheduled my night with 3 back to back calls. That leads me to try to "indulge" which throws me off | Y | | | I need time to myself most nights, I can't add to my busy nights no matter how tempting it may be |
| Started work again having no idea what to do in the morning. I keep having it happen where I get to work and have no idea what's going on. | | | Y | I think by copying what I do with Neil and I daily, carrying over todos from one day to another, I can fix this. I think to do that I need to starting including dates in the stories I'm working on up at the top, like a mini daily journal. |
| Last night I felt distant from Liv so I just talked about my problems. I thought that I wasn't being open enough, but that wasn't quite it. Not sure what's going on but what I did was not the right move. I'm proud of trying but bummed I didn't give it more thought. | Y | | | Not sure what insights to draw from this. She didn't seem psyched about talking about things, but I am bummed it took me so long to recognize she was on edge. I guess one thing to take from this is that when she is snippy, something is up. I think I kind of snipped back instead of taking a moment to realize she was off |

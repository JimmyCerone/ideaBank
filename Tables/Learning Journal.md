| Navigate files from one's you know using F12 - it's like finding familiar landmarks when you are driving | Atomic Object | Jordan | |
| OnContextMenu is how you can capture right clicks on the UI | Learned this on [[FUS-1676 - A user can override a price record while price editing - Frontend]] with #AtomicObject  | Lydia | |
| Databases are like homes in that they can be partly functional. There can be leaks (like my A/C) without the whole thing being broken | #AtomicObject | On my own / Lydia, Jordan, & Andy | |
| Typescript requires that you have a constant when checking for type. Otherwise, the type could change and therefore it can't be guaranteed. If you have a constant, you can use the in keyword to narrow the type and discriminate one type from another.  | #AtomicObject  | Jordan | #Typescript |
| Bookmarks #PlugIn  in #VSCode allows you to move quickly between points in code | #AtomicObject  | Jordan | I can use bookmarks to move more quickly around my shell |
| Use multi cursor when adding text, not just removing it | #AtomicObject | Jordan | I've started using multicursor to delete stuff but Jordan uses it to add things like curly braces when he's making multiple new objects and I'd like to do the same. He also utilizes interesting selectors for the multi cursor, like colons. |
| Hold down option and move the arrow keys up or down and the current line will move with it | #AtomicObject  | Jordan | this can make it easy to move a line up or down, like vim but a tad easier | 
| Content length mismatch often means the server has gone wonky and can be fixed by running kill-all node | #AtomicObject  | Jordan | Weird error that can be fixed easily (I know now) |
| Copy a file from one branch into another branch - `git checkout origin/develop FILE_PATH`| Useful for tests because you can see if the problem was preexisting | Lydia | |
| orderBy is a lodash function that can be ordered by custom attributes | #AtomicObject | Meredith | I can use orderBy to order complex objects using lambdas. |

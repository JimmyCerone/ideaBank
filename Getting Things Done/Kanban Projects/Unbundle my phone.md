		- Just going to get a cheap one because in reality it's a back up. The phone has this well solved, I just want something "just in case" the phone fails.
- [ ] Search for a cheap GPS < $50
	- Will Goodwill have one?


### Light Phone Update

- Decided against the Light Phone on the grounds that I do't feel like my phone is a problem. Only problem spot is reading articles, which I'll shift to Remarkable and ban (other than finding articles) on iPhone. Actuflow works very well. The big problem is my laptop, not my phone. Though GPS is still good b/c back up.

- In the end, imessages and other stuff is too valuable to switch to Light Phone.

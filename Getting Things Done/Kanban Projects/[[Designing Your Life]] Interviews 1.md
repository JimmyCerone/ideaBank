### Findings

#### Would I like being a teacher? 
- From [[Aaron Reider]], I probably would enjoy the work but not the lifestyle (60+ hour weeks). It would leave little time for the creative exploration I crave

#### Would I like being a professor? 
- Here's the answer from Ortiz: 
Thank you for your email.  Becoming a professor mean passing through graduate school.  My advice on grad school i:

1. Don't go.
2. Seriously, don't go.  It is an unhappy life and will exacerbate all your vices.

If you ignore advice above, then there are condition upon which you should go to graduate school:

1. Only go if you have a clear academic interest that can only be satisfied by going to grad school.  If you just like reading or think being a professor might be fun, then you should not do it.  Get a library card.  Start a book club.  Join a teaching program.

2. Only go if you are getting paid. Do not go into debt.

3. Be open to the idea you will never get a nice professor job.  There are fewer prof jobs now, there is a large backlog of unemployed PhDs, and there is no guarantee that you will land one of the few available spots.  If you do, it is generally a happy life.  But the chances of landing a job are not high.

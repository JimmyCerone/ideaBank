## Next Actions
- [x] Setup travel ($25) and food ($300) automation
- [x] Determine amount for clothing and other categories
- [x] define a successful budget 
	- This is a tough one. What is the purpose of a budget? I used to think it was to visualize spending, and I still think that's the case. Yet I'm finding that I overspend when left to my own devices. Yet I also underspend, not buying things I need or that would bring good value (like the Soylent I bought - a good experiment). 
	- **So I guess a good budget helps me understand where my money is going while helping me make good decisions about what to spend it on. **
		- What I've found with my current budget is that I avoid making good, small bets, and instead make big bets at the end of the month. 
	- I think I should separate experiments from finances. In the past, my experiments were driven by finances but I think it should be the reverse. So I think I will make an experimental purchases section. No, I think purchases are just an action step so I don't need anything new or separate. 
- [x] What tools help me have a successful budget?
	- Everydollar helps me strategize, but inputting the money is annoying. I love the UI, but I think I could find an easier tool to use. Perhaps Mint? Though I hate the thought of Intuit having my data, I think it might be the best way to go. 
	- I could also automate savings with buckets in my savings account at the beginning of the month and have the rest set aside as "safe to spend". That seems like the best approach, getting the money where it needs to go and letting me focus on the other shit. I can transfer money around every week, giving me insights. That makes good sense to me. 
		- [x] Check HSA Bank auto transfers to see if adam set this up
			- [x] The $125 biweekly contribution is setup and I'm getting my HSA $ this month so I should be good to go here. I think I manually did this (never automated it)
		- [x] Check TD Ameritrade to set up automated transfers
		- [x] Check everydollar to find more automated places for budgeting
			- Going to automate the payment of my phone bill
- [x] Write about whether to go with the alarm clock idea or safe to spend idea
	- [x] Ended up going with the safe to spend
- [x] Research potential tools given above decisions
	- [x] Ended up being able to use [[Ally Bank]] for almost all of it
- [x] Write about the process of pulling money out of funds for purchases (the funds are nice but I'm not updating them at all right now)
	- [x] I need to be better about doing this in the moment - that's the goal! It's a < 2 minute action so it should happen right away. I'm dropping the number and I think doing it beforehand would be helpful (for known purchases at least)

## Actions
- [x] Why do I want to be more digitally minimalist?
	- I think it's important to point out that I'm not looking to get more done, just looking to be more focused when I do decide to get things done. I'm not against [[Twitter]] and [[Google]]'s YouTUbe but I want to go there with a purpose other than mindless distraction. That, or I want to use them to learn as both are great tools for that. So I guess my "why" is I want to be more focused and *enjoy* the services I use more, instead of using them as distractions. My goal I guess is to redirect my distraction to something like the [[Remarkable]]. 
	- What services do I use most? 
		- YouTube
			- I think I can safely ban this altogether for the next 30 days. I never *need* it and I could watch on the TV if I really wanted to. 
		- Twitter
			- This one is such a problem that I want to spend 30 days without it just to reassess it's value. 
		- Hey
			- I think a similar strategy to messages would work. I want access to this, but not as a distraction per se. I want my "distraction" to be writing down my thoughts on the [[Remarkable]].
		- Messages
			- Do I want to block this at work? I think this I could block except for every 25 minutes or so. 
		- Matter
			- Just deleted this from my phone and felt very sad about it. A real bummer to lose that app. But I have the digest that I get weekly so I will just have to be good about checking that. So far this has been by far my best source of [[Read uncommon sources of information]]. 
- [x] Decide what applications and websites I want to block
	- Twitter & YouTube (all the time for the next 30 days)
	- Hey & Messages (Blocked pomodoro style)
	- Matter (deleted from my phone)
- [x] Decide for how long and to what extent I should block said applications
- [x] Create Cold Turkey Blocker blocks given above rules (consider making it last a month)
	- In the end, I created a block from 11:55 to 12:05 for Twitter and YouTube. That way I can sneak in and make a change (though I didn't lock it, so I suppose I can just turn it off). I made the Hey and Messages ban just during the work day M-F and on a [[202106091124 - Pomodoro Technique]] schedule.

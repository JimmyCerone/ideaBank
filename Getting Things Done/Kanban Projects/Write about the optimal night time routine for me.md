## Notes
#### What I know: 
- Night time routine is intimately connected with morning routine. 

    - _What I know about morning routine:_

    - I don't do well trying to work in the morning (calls are fine) because I end up super stressed before bed. 
    - Running in the morning works well but I have trouble getting to bed on time.
    
**5 Whys Framework**
Why do I have trouble getting to bed on time?
 
- FOMO ( I always want to do one more thing )
- Most time spent hanging out with people (and good convos) happen late

Why do I have FOMO? 

- I have tons of projects and things to learn and not enough time to do it all

Why do I have tons of projects and things to learn? 

- I feel a need to prove myself and have difficulty delineating what is important and what is merely interesting. 

Why do I have trouble figuring out what is important?

- I don't have a firm grip on my values and I don't ask why before doing things often enough. 

** What if before I undertook a project lasting more than an hour I asked myself why and wrote about it in my journal?**

Why do I have to prove myself? 

- I don't feel I have accomplished enough or am impressive enough to be considered worthwhile

Why do I feel I haven't accomplished enough? 

- I think that others have accomplished much more and feel left behind. 

**What if I more consistently reminded myself that _I'm learning_ (my favorite motto)?**  

Why do I hang out with people late? 

- That seems to be the time most people are able to. 

Why do most people hang out late? 

- They often have events or food to do earlier and work late

**What if I worked on coordinating event attendance and meals during the week?**


Implementation
============================

- No phone after 9
- No events starting after 8
- Look at next day at 8

Morning:

- 6:30 wakeup 4 days a week (latest is 7:30)
- Run and meditate > 4 days

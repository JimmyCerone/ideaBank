## Reflections
- Loved this idea and in particular, the clarification offered by this quote:
	> "Love and Power," writes Tillich, "are often contrasted in such a way that love is identified with a resignation of power and power with a denial of love. Powerless love and loveless power are contrasted. . . . But such an understanding is error and confusion."40 Therefore he rejects the traditional view, with its emphasis on emotion, as an inadequate representation of love. Since love is "the reunion of the estranged"41 (and one may be estranged from self as well as from another); and since power is the "possibility of self-affirmation in spite of internal and external negation,"
	> Tillich says, "Love is the foundation, not the negation of power. "
## Connections
- [[202104130856 - Love and righteousness]] connect deeply here. This idea adds the layer of power, which I think is critical after reading [[How to Be Antiracist by Ibram X. Kendi]]. [[202103181540 - Power is the key to relieving oppression]] comes from Kendi which seems to contradict [[202103131751 - Power imbalances attract those who seek control]]. Well, no. Power imbalances are bad but where power is already imbalanced more power on the side of the weaker party is good.

## Idea
- When you regulate something, be prepared to play whack a mole unless you do some smart stuff like [[Switch - How to Change Things When Change is Hard by Dan and Chip Heath]].

## Question 

- Not sure what makes some regulations successful and what makes some others fail yet. 
	- I think it is when it's inconsistent and unclear. 
		- I think this is sometimes brought up as an example for #Libertarian but I think it's a #StrawMan
	- Some clarity would probably come from bringing in concepts of supply & demand based on Dopesick example.

## Example
- [[Lethal Passage - The Story of a Gun by Erik Larson]]. here the regulatory problems seem to stem from [[202104060852 - Enumerate vs reserved powers]], which could give a hint at something of an answer. When things are unclear and inconsistent, you end up playing whack a mole. 
- [[Dopesick by Beth Macy]] saw this in a different manifestation, where addiction adds a type of [[03062021 - Levers]]. Even when it's consistent and clear, addiction creates "leakage" because there is an outside force on the demand.

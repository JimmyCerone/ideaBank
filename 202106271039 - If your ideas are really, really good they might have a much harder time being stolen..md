## Idea
- Good ideas are hard for people to accept because they often mean change, which is hard (see [[Switch - How to Change Things When Change is Hard by Dan and Chip Heath]] and others)

## Connections
- Anything change related is hard, see [[Switch - How to Change Things When Change is Hard by Dan and Chip Heath]], [[The Power of Habits by Charles Duhigg]], and more. 
- Another connection for [[202103261112 - The future is inherently unpredictable]] and [[202105031552 - The future is unbelievable now and what's believable now isn't the future]]. 
- Also lends credence to the idea that [[202104070856 - The future is already here, it's just not evenly distributed]], but with different reasoning. The future isn't evenly distributed in part because of inequality but also in part because good ideas often require change, which most would like to avoid.

## Example
- The Beautitudes, universal health care, [[Pedagogy of the Oppressed by Paolo Frieri]].

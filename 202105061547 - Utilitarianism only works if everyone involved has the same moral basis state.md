## Idea
- Utilitarianism assumes that you can calculate the amount of good for different actions and compare them. The problem with that is that you are assuming the same ethical basis state (basis state concept stolen from [[Quantum Country by Andu Mutaschak and Michael Nielson]]) for everyone involved. Rarely is that true. So utilitarianism works from one vantage point but the "calculations" break down if you change someone's assumptions. 

## Example
- [[202103142250 - All cultures have scales of immorality that apply differently to out groups]] & [[202103131903 - The problems that an outsider observes are vastly different than those an insider identifies]] both empirically show the nature of this problem.

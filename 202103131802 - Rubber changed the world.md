## Context
- The #Profit from #Rubber is what made the Congo profitable for [[King Leopold's Ghost]]. It made cars work, and in an odd connection, made [[The Wright Brothers by David]] enough #Money via their #Bike #Business that they could #Fly. 
- Further, rubber allowed for the creation of telegraph and telephone wiring that made AT&T boom, connecting this idea to [[The Idea Factory]]. 
- It was the boom in rubber in the 1890s that made King Leopold his money in the Congo. 
- Rubber was discovered by Charles Goodyear int the 1840s but wasn't commercialized until the 1890s. This is a contradiction to my previous idea [[03072021 - Inventors rarely take their innovations to market]].

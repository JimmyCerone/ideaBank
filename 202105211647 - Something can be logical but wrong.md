## Idea
- You can create a logical argument that is coherent but based on incorrect premises, which makes it wrong. 
## Connections
- Lots of convincing arguments that sway me, especially from [[Will Lake]], end up being like this. What I'm finding is that incorrect premises often come from [[202105211614 - Snapshots are accurate but not the truth]] and [[202104211317 - Inductive reasoning is often misused when addressing systemic problems]]. 
## Example
- Basically correlation doesn't equal causation. So I could say when I put my fut down on the pedal my car drives which means that humans are required for cars to drive. 
	- Not the greatest example. #InProgress

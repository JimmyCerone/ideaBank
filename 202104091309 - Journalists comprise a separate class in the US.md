Balaji claimed that #Journalist s have become a separate #Class in #America, much like soldiers have because of the US's standing army ([[202104091314 - The US was never intended to have a standing army]]). 

Therefore he advocates for citizen journalists, which I'm just unsure about. On one hand, I like it because [[03062021 - Small obscure journals can be a fertile source of the early jump]]. Yet I'm kind of frustrated with the critiques of the #Media. I think most of them fall flat. Though Tim Ferris ([[11 Reasons Not to Become Famous - Tim Ferris]]) and [[Still Alive by Astral Codex Ten]] show that journalists can misuse their #Power, journalist have broken lots of big stories that improved our society. I'm not necessarily against citizen journalists, I think local news is good, but I'm not certain that abolishing corporate journalism is necessary or even good. I think most of all, I'm unclear about the critique. What is so bad about these journals? I trust the critique of people like [[Black Power and Black Theology by James Cone]] but not so much Balaji, who I consider part of the bourgeousias. 

Further, I think [[03102021 - The development of independent journalism and newsletters degrades journalistic integrity]] gives me further pause. Maybe this comes close to my critique. I think it's a good thing that journals are well vetted. Not trusting journalists and saying they are bad for substantative reasons (not sure [[202104070847 - Founders can choose product quality or distribution]] counts) are two different things. What I find stupid is that there is no guarantee that citizen journalists are any more or less trustworthy than corporations. Or at least that's one of my #Assumptions. This bears more thinking.

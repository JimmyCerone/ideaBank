## Context
- Came across this idea in Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl. I heard of this first in Donald Miller's book [[Scary Close by Donald Miller]] and then read it with [[Joey Dawson]]. 

## Idea
- Frankl says that humans have a will to meaning, that to live well, we must have meaning.

## Insights
- The #Housing idea I had about putting people up in housing is more complicated in areas with #Gangs, where your housing options are restricted by gang lines as well as economics. 
- #Prisons are certainly not for #Rehabilitation and are in fact much worse than I previously imagined. There is little to no attempt to build healthy #Community, which would likely alleviate many of the struggles. 
- #ToxicMasculinity seems to dominate in these prisons, which makes me question how to solve issues. 
- Some people use #Drugs as a stimulant to work longer hours

## Questions
- How can you create healing and build respect without engaging in violence or working within the system?
- Why do we punish #Drug abuse with prison? Where are the roots of prison?
- Why do we go for symptoms, not roots? Why do rich drug users get off? Do they?
- Would a prison preparation program be helpful to teach people how to survive? Does something like this exist?
- Is geographical separation the only way to decrease #Recidivism? Has this been attempted?
- Are people's reasons for using #Drugs addressed in prison?

Yet another [[Kevin James]] movie. I cannot resist a Kevin James movie. There is something so amazing about a character who doesn't believe in themselves becoming something more than what they once were. I like how disarming he is as well. 

## Connections

- This one is a lot like the Will Ferrell movie, [[Stranger than Fiction]]. A blend of #Fiction and #Nonfiction except flipped. In Stranger than Fiction there is a random author who controls [[Will Ferrell]]'s life. In this movie, [[Kevin James]] is a writer whose book gets published as nonfiction. 

- The movie reminds me of [[11 Reasons Not to Become Famous - Tim Ferris]] in that writing can have unintended consequences. 

## Ideas
- Kevin James plays with #ToxicMasculinity in this book as he's a writer with little machismo, yet is supposed to stand in as an assassin in Venezuala. Reminds me as well of [[Get Smart]].


## Reflections
- In the final moments of the #Movie , the "good" opposition leader tells his second in command to be be a "man" and kill the DEA cop. At that moment, [[Kevin James]] runs in and says, "Be your own man". Ironically, the female character is still left as the damsel in distress, even as she ostensibly the most experienced and well training there. 
- The movie had so many twists and turns, people kept showing up to kill him and the plot got so complex, then in the end the old man from the bar is the Ghost and comes and saves him.
- I kind of like that there wasn't much emphasis on romance throughout the movie. The second in command becomes the president, with a hint of romance with him and the DEA agents. 
- What a twist! In the end the story is flipped on it's head again as he writes a #Fiction book about his real experiences in Venezuala.

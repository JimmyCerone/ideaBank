## Reflections
- What's interesting here is how to avoid restricting choice in a way that makes it impossible to discover new things. How do you make sure this curation process doens't kill diversity and put you into a wormhole (like [[Google]] does with YouTube)? 
- In some ways, this is a different iteration of [[03-03-2021 - Our language creates our reality]]. What we see also helps create our reality. What happens when whole swathes of content are hidden from our eyes by [[AI]]? [[202104222236 - Machine learning is biased.]] so how do we account for that? The systems that preceded it were biased as well, I must acknowledge, but this is a new type of problem. 
- In some ways, I curate my own feed with [[Basecamp]]'s Hey. Do I do that well? How can I evolve? 
- Reminds me of [[Rising Out of Hatred by Eli Saslow]], in that most of the white supremacists in there just keep self curating more and more extreme books. This shit existed before the internet, but [[202103302306 - The internet removes the middle and creates extremistan]] so now we see it at a larger scale.

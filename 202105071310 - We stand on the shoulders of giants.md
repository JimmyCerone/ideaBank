## Idea
- All ideas are based on the ideas of those that precede them. Or alternatively we stand on the shoulders of our parents etc.
- An interesting corollary of [[03-03-2021 - Our language creates our reality]] and [[202105071351 - Adjacent Possible]]. We can only see as far as those around us. Part of this is in an interesting limitation made by [[202105071301 - All technological innovations are connected]]. You can't "pull away" from all other innovations in one fell swoop because they are all connected. 

## Example
- [[Obsidian]] is just this in tech form.

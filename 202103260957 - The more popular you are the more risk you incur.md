## Connections
- Heavily informed by both [[Why I'm Unreachable]] and [[11 Reasons Not to Become Famous - Tim Ferris]] yet also has deep connections to the [[Black Swan by Nassim Taleb]] and #Risk. 
- While there is considerable #Risk in #Fame, there is also potential for great reward according to the [[03062021 - The higher the initial investment, the higher the risk (and potential reward - sometimes)]]. I think most #People miss the high risk of fame, an idea also central to #Capitalism in general. Glad folks like Tim Ferriss pointed it out to me.

## Idea
- The idea is simple: the more people you come across, the higher the #Risk. 

## Examples
- You see this all the time in [[Hellbound on His Trail by Hampton Sides]] and other cases where fame brings great danger.

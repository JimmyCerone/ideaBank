## Idea
- The human brain is made to seek out novelty ([[The Righteous Mind]]) and conflict. So that is what sticks out to us, unusual crazy things. Over time, we become blind to more nefarious things that seem normal to us, which is part of why [[202103131903 - The problems that an outsider observes are vastly different than those an insider identifies]]. 

## Connections
- Reminds me a lot of the [[Black Swan by Nassim Taleb]] in reverse. We love extremistan but always assume we live in mediocristan. Conversely if the extremistan we live in has been around for a while, we end up thinking it's normal. 
- An extension of [[Humans have limited memories]] and [[202103261111 - Humans are terrible predictors]]. We have a hard time connecting things together if they are big which means we overreact to small things but underreact to big ones. 
- This tendency is part of why [[202104050849 - Offloading responsibility is manipulative]] is so easy to get away with. We don't predict well and then we struggle to see and understand big, common things and how they affect our health, whether it be guns ([[Lethal Passage - The Story of a Gun by Erik Larson]]), drugs ([[Dopesick by Beth Macy]]) or computers ([[How the Personal Computer Broke the Human Body]] && [[The Child Safety Problem on Platforms is Worse Than We Knew]])
- Another reason we struggle with the common is that [[202105051320 - Change is hard because people wear themselves out]] & [[202105101046 - Change isn't an event, it's a process]]. When we think of bad things happening or causes, we look for events and specific instances when that isn't how change works. Further, we look at the implications of the statements and realize that it would require change, which is hard ([[Switch - How to Change Things When Change is Hard by Dan and Chip Heath]] & [[The Power of Habits by Charles Duhigg]])

## Example
- Lung cancer and smoking were not considered correlated because how could it be? It was so common, there was no way something that common could be causal!

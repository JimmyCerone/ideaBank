## Context
- King Leopold's quest for #Colonialism happened very slowly. In [[King Leopold's Ghost]], it shows how he slowly transitioned from simply exploring #Africa to #Exporting all of it's goods. It took 20+ years to create and even longer to dismantle (if it ever was). Atrocities happen in the same way that #Grooming and other forms of abuse do, probably because the same #Personality types commit these crimes. There is testing of #Boundaries throughout and things slowly worsen as people see what they can get away with. 

## Connections
- How does this connect with [[Will to Meaning vs Pleasure]]? Is it that some people are just wired "wrong"? Or do they find meaning in "bad" things? 
- In light of [[03-03-2021 - Language can be violent]], I wonder if there are warning signs.... Could the abuse of Muslims in #China have been predicted by their language towards them? 
- I think that sadly, just as [[03062021 - Innovations come in clusters]], so do atrocities. Is there something about innovation and atrocity that is similar? Since we know what stifles #Innovation, can we use the same principles to stifle atrocities?
- In an odd twist on [[03062021 - Innovators often look crazy until their ideas come to fruition]], the opposite is true of people creating atrocities. They often look great until they are exposed all at once.

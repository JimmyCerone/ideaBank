## Idea
- Weak ties are strong [[03062021 - Levers]] that I want to cultivate more directly to:
	- increase my involvement in activism
	- Open up my career opportunities
	- Bring new ideas in
- Can I create a system for this?

## Example
- Surprising but true is that most employment opportunities come from weak ties, not strong ones, because the weak ties makes us aware of opportunities not directly available in our network. Makes me want to create a habit of cultivating weak habits in some kind of sustainable way.

## Idea
- I'm not sure about this idea yet. I think it's interesting to consider they idea that training someone to use a #Gun as the "good" guy also means they have the potential to be the bad guy according to [[202103302314 - Humans are not wholly good or bad]]. The idea of the [[033020212315 - Hot State]] also muddies the water here. Yeah the "good guy" wouldn't normally kill himself or someone else but in a hot state he would make different decisions.

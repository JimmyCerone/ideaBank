An idea from [[202103291336 - The Episode of Everything - Balaji on Bitcoin]] that attempts to provide a [[202103302250 - Third path or Buddhist Middle Way]]. 

According to Balaji, the concept is that:
	- Conservatives want things to stay the same
	- Progressives are zero sum
	- Libertarians say live and let live
	
His #Philosophy, which of course is better (he was a tad arrogant) is that you can have a win and help win perspective which is positive sum, unlike progressives. It's basically if you apply the #Tech #Startup mentality to everything (which I'm not for).

## Reflections
- Just ran into this with [[Tuple]] vs [[Pop]]. Ended up choosing [[Pop]] because it doesn't require your credit card for a free trail (has just a free option forever basically).
- The subscription model is interesting because I feel like I rarely use it. I often share it, I guess. I use my parent's [[Netflix]] and Liv's [[Hulu]]. I guess I pay for [[Basecamp]]'s Hey. I would definitely pay for [[Obsidian]]. What makes the difference? Interesting in light of [[202104191437 - Using Patreon to fund independent research]]. What makes that "subscription" worth it? Is it a subscription? 
- Fundamentally weird reality we face here with the fact you can use things for #Free. The #Internet seems to have enabled that as before you couldn't replicate things at that scale. 
- There's all kinds of #Psychology I'd love to learn about here. Tons of insights, I'm sure. 

## Connections
- I feel like [[202104191438 - The internet enabled the creation of the "free" model]], in part because [[202103302306 - The internet removes the middle and creates extremistan]] as a result of [[202103302307 - The internet increases variance]]. These free trails wouldn't be around (I don't think) without the internet which makes this a new and weird phenomenon. The phenomenon may be short lived because [[202104191440 - Crypto enables micropayments]] which could reverse this trend.

- I first came across this idea from my mom and from [[Thaddeus Rex]], who wrote about leaving #Gas in the tank for crazy times. This idea is why I do #Budgeting the way I do. I have all these extra funds to cover for [[Black Swan by Nassim Taleb]]s. That whole book is a diatribe against the idea the #Efficiency is everything. #Systems thinking would advocate on this idea. [[Cheap - The High Cost of Discount Culture]] wrote about this idea at length.

I'd never considered this idea but now that I've heard it it seems obvious. Fascinating concept from [[Black Power and Black Theology by James Cone]]. 

I think my favorite part about this idea is that Cone extends the idea to make it the reason #Intellectual work is worthwhile at all. Since [[03-03-2021 - Our language creates our reality]], analyzing reality requires us to understand our words in context. 

> But in another sense, this criticism is surprising, since every literate person knows that imprecision, the inability of a word to describe accurately the object of reality to which it points, is characteristic of all languages. The complexity of this problem is evident in the development of modern analytical philosophy. We are still in the process of defining such terms as "democracy," "good," "evil," and many others. In fact the ability to probe for deeper meanings of words as they relate to various manifestations of reality is what makes the intellectual pursuit interesting and worthwhile.

- Deep connection here as well with [[The Information - A History, A Theory, A Flood by james Gleick]] where dictionaries are discussed in depth as an interesting physical manifestation of the problem.

## Reflections
- Interesting given how much confidence I have in Ray Dalio's predictions given his [[Principles by Ray Dalio]]. 
- There does seem to be a decent chance that we are in a bubble or will end up in one soon. I wish I understood this #Economics stuff better, it would be very helpful. This does remind me of my obsession with preparedness. I would be somewhat excited for a recession of sorts because of the economic opportunities it presents, assuming I remain employed.

## Ideas
- Uses #Levers to understand what might cause a #Bubble in the market: 
1.  How high are prices relative to traditional measures?
2.  Are prices discounting unsustainable conditions?
3.  How many new buyers (i.e., those who werenâ€™t previously in the market) have entered the market?
4.  How broadly bullish is sentiment?
5.  Are purchases being financed by high leverage?
6.  Have buyers made exceptionally extended forward purchases (e.g., built inventory, contracted forward purchases, etc.) to speculate or protect themselves against future price gains?

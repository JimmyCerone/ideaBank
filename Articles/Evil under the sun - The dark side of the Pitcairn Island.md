## Reflections
- A tragic #History for a tiny island with sexual assault and rape as the norm. The island was the result of a mutiny of sorts and was settled by folks who stole a boat and ran away (as best as I can understand). The same family has lived on the island for generations. By now, the population is dwindling and most of the males are in jail for sex crimes.

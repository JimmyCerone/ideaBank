## Excerpts
- This hit me particularly hard:
	> To kick off this post, let’s start with a real example from 2010. I vividly remember the day I received an email from someone we’ll call “James.” James was a frequent commenter on my blog, and we’d become friendly over time. He was a great guy and a huge help to other readers. I’d given him advice, he’d built a few successful businesses, and we’d developed a nice virtual rapport. That day in 2010, however, I actually received an email from James’ longtime assistant. It was succinct: “James learned so much from you, and he instructed me to give you this video.” I clicked on the attachment. James popped up. He was clearly agitated and clenching his jaw, making contorted faces and speaking strangely. He thanked me for all of my help over the years and explained that it had helped him through some very dark times. He finished by saying that he was sorry, but that he had to end things. That’s when he turned off the video and killed himself.
	> This experience profoundly fucked me up for a long period of time.
	> Suffice to say, I didn’t realize that this type of thing was part of the Faustian fame-seeking bargain.
- I'd never considered this fact, that fame could happen before you are ready for it: 
>My hope is that this post will help people better understand the wall their ladder is leaning against… before they spend years climbing towards the top. Or, in a world of TikTok-like acceleration, before they let the genie out of the bottle without thinking it through.
- #Levers 
> Using #Fame as a lever, however, can be tricky. 
> First off, what type of “fame” do you want? In concrete terms, what would “successful” look like and over what period of time? From 0–100%, how confident are you that you can convert exposure to income? If more than 0%, what evidence do you have to suggest that your strategy will work? Do you have a plan for becoming _un_famous if you don’t like it?
- Fascinating takes that have drastically shaped my thinking now: 
> During my college years, one of my dorm mate’s dads was a famous Hollywood producer. He once said to me, “You want everyone to know your name and no one to know your face.”
> Taking it a step further, we could quote Bill Murray:
> I always want to say to people who want to be rich and famous: ‘try being rich first.’ See if that doesn’t cover most of it. There’s not much downside to being rich, other than paying taxes and having your relatives ask you for money. But when you become famous, you end up with a 24-hour job. . . . The only good thing about fame is that I’ve gotten out of a couple of speeding tickets. I’ve gotten into a restaurant when I didn’t have a suit and tie on. That’s really about it.
- Scary to imagine what might be said to me and the people I love:
> This same “White horseman” reader proceeded to send me more than a dozen increasingly threatening emails, concluding with “I shall deliver you on judgment day.”
> Was that a death threat? Was there anything I should do or could do about it? I’d never dealt with such things, and I didn’t know. But I did know one thing: it was very scary and completely out of the blue.
- I think I want to keep my blog in the range of the first one - might want to make it private and invite only...
	> In that short span of time, my monthly blog audience had exploded from a small group of friends (20–30?) to the current size of Providence, Rhode Island (180,–200,000 people).
- Terrifying thing I've never thought of: 
	> **The point is this: you don’t need to do anything _wrong_** **to get death threats, rape threats, etc. You just need a big enough audience.** Think of yourself as the leader of a tribe or the mayor of a city.
- The decision to have a large audience is hard to undo: 
	> If you’ve ever wondered why many celebrities disappear for a period of time, sometimes years, it’s often in the hopes that the below will fade or go away. Sadly, it’s very hard to put the toothpaste back in the toothpaste tube once you have a large Google footprint.
- This is insane! He's not even that big compared to some: 
	> Many more people followed. My little townhouse was cute, but it was totally unprotected: no gate, no nothing. Eventually, one male stalker ended up hanging out in front of my house nonstop, taking pictures and posting them on social media with comments like “Too bad Tim Ferriss isn’t home. I missed him again!” Things snowballed from there, and I had to sell the house and move. When traveling, I’ve also had to stop posting photos to social until well after the fact. Why? I’ve had people triangulate the city I’m visiting, call _every_ hotel in the city to ask for a registered guest with my last name, and then _fly_ to the country to find me and/or my family. I’ve since learned to use pseudonyms, but we’ll get to that later…
- Another risk people don't talk about when they tell people to build their own brand. Why doesn't GaryV talk about this??
	> Just months before this happened, two well-known YouTubers in Austin, Texas, had a fan drive 11 hours from New Mexico to their house with a car full of guns. He intended to kill at least one of them. He broke into their home at 4am and hunted for them from room to room, .45-caliber handgun in hand. They hid in a closet and frantically called 911. From [related media coverage](https://www.krqe.com/news/police-albuquerque-man-targeted-texas-youtube-celebrities/): “They’re a popular Texas couple on YouTube, but they never thought that would put their lives in danger. That is until an Albuquerque stalker showed up at their house in the middle of the night with a gun and bad intentions.” Fortunately, the police arrived, and the intruder ended up dead, but it could’ve easily ended differently. In some cases, the intended target gets blown away before they even realize what’s happening. Ironically, it’s often the diehard fans professing love who kill them, not “haters” of any type.
- Also terrible: 
> As you might imagine, dating can be a quagmire of liabilities and bear traps. It could be someone hoping to write a clickbait article about their date with you (obviously without disclosing such), or it could be much worse. If you’re a female, this is where things can once again become physically dangerous. If you’re a male, this is where things can become legally dangerous. There are many predators for both sides, and it can make you lose your faith in humanity.
- An interesting strategy I would rather not take: 
> Fortunately, I’ve spent years deliberately talking about controversial topics and disclosing uncomfortable personal stories. In part, this has been to avoid the temptation to create a squeaky-clean public persona. It also robs would-be extortionists of a lot of common ammo.
- So many things I never thought of, this sounds exhausting: 
> For all of the reasons in this post (and many more), if you’re doing anything public, you should _never_ have anything mailed to where you live. If you [violate that even once](https://twitter.com/nathanbarry/status/1223279622755799040), it’s likely that your name and associated address will end up in company or government databases. Those mailing lists are then rented and traded as revenue streams, and it all ultimately ends up searchable. Remember the story of the Austin YouTubers hunted in their own home? Don’t be them. For safety, unless you want to take huge risks, use a UPS Store or other off-site mailing address for everything. This is a must-have, not a nice-to-have.
- Yet another prescient point: 
	> Instead, fame is likely to magnify all of your insecurities and exaggerate all of your fears. It’s like picking up a fire extinguisher for your pain that ends up being a canister of gasoline.


## Questions
- How can I limit my public exposure? 
- How can I avoid fame?




## Reflections

Both this article, [[Still Alive by Astral Codex Ten]], and [[The Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz]] have informed my thinking a lot as of late. I am no longer as interested as I once was in become famous and powerful (as a CEO, in particular). I realized all this when #Blue left for Liv's house and I made the [[Choosing Not to Write a Book]] decision. These things I've been chasing felt empty. I want to enjoy life and I'm realizing that being "average" and having fun and relaxing can be good things. I don't always have to have 11 projects going on, in part because the goal that leads to is something I don't want. Being famous is not all it's cracked up to be and I'm realizing I'd rather share my interesting ideas with close friends than with the whole world. 

In the past, I was naive about what fame and fortune brought. It does do some cool things, but the downsides are enormous. I think it was an actor who said, "I would rather be rich than rich and famous".

L’Chaim and Its Limits: Why Not #Immortality?

I reached out to Dr. Ortiz about [[Sapiens]] after reading about Homo Deus, wondering about how humanity would change if we were no longer quite mortal. Ortiz sent Leon Kass's article over. 

I'm also interested in connecting these ideas to [[Superintelligence]], which talked about moving the human brain to a computer for another form of #Immortality.

## Ideas
- The article pushes back on the idea that immortality is an unqualified good.
	- Argues mortality is part of human nature
		- This is fair. Biologically, we were designed for shorter life spans and it would be quite an adjustment to live longer. But so was gaining the neocortex. This doesn't mean it's fundamentally against our nature, just new. 
	- Argues that children will suffer as there will be no more posterity
		- This is somewhat troubling. I think though that we can't imagine what it would be like and it's kind of stupid to say it _will_ be bad or it _might_ be bad without offering some kind of proof. The reality is we have no idea what this would look like. 
		- There's no reason in my mind that elders would block children out or neglect them for their career or some other alternative. This already happens now, and I'm unsure if it would become more or less common. 
	- Argues that people get bored and lose their zeal
		- This is my least favorite argument as I know plenty of old people who change and adapt and bring new ideas into the world (Danny). Being old and grumpy is not an inevitable state and this borders on ageism. 
		- Similarly, young people don't always come up with new, good ideas. Look at the alt-rights rise among youth.
	- Argues that unjust distribution could cause real problems
		- I have a hard time disagreeing with this. Reminds me of the Justin Timberlake movie...
			>But other critics worry that technology’s gift of long or immortal life will not be granted to everyone, especially if, as is likely, the treatments turn out to be expensive. Would it not be the ultimate injustice if only some people could afford a deathless existence, if the world were divided not only into rich and poor but into mortal and immortal?
	- Death would be even more tragic
		- Once again, this is an excellent point.
		> Would not death become even more of an affront? Would not the fear and loathing of death increase in the absence of its harbingers? We could no longer comfort the widow by pointing out that her husband was delivered from his suffering. Death would always be untimely, unprepared for, shocking.
	- Lack of time as a motivator would be gone
		- I think this is a stupid argument. I think he underestimates what passion can do. Basically I think he assumes we are all driven by fear of death and without it we would do nothing. Not sure that's a valid assumption.
		> For most activities, and for most of us, I think it is crucial that we recognize and feel the force of not having world enough and time.
	- The most convincing argument for me is that it's not #Immortality that we are striving for, but something else.
		> Why do we want to live longer or forever? Is it really first and most because we do not want to die, because we do not want to leave this embodied life on earth or give up our earthly pastimes, because we want to see more and do more? I do not think so. This may be what we say, but it is not what we finally mean. Mortality as such is not our defect, nor bodily immortality our goal. Rather, mortality is at most a pointer, a derivative manifestation, or an accompaniment of some deeper deficiency. The promise of immortality and eternity answers rather to a deep truth about the human soul: the human soul yearns for, longs for, aspires to some condition, some state, some goal toward which our earthly activities are directed but which cannot be attained in earthly life.
	- Argues that all the people who want immortality say God is dead and there is no meaning to life
		- This is a pretty crappy straw man characterization of people who aren't religious.
		> It is probably no accident that it is a generation whose intelligentsia proclaim the death of God and the meaninglessness of life that embarks on life’s indefinite prolongation and that seeks to cure the emptiness of life by extending it forever.
	- Children are our immortality
		- This is an interesting point but I'm not sure this has to be. Again he seems to be projecting the future given the present. There's no reason I can see that we can't have both. 
		> Children and their education, not growth hormone and perpetual organ replacement, are life’s—and wisdom’s—answer to mortality.
	- The Tree of Life was taken away once the knowledge of good & evil was attained for a reason
		- This is another interesting point and it pushes on the assumption that with age comes wisdom. It could be true that increasing age further corrupts us, though again I'm not sure that's a given.

## Reflections
- Now this, as compared with [[Standard Note]]'s article [[The Unexpected Benefits of Encrypted Writing]], is something I can get behind. The emphasis on longevity feels new and fresh, yet it's an old idea. What a stunning combo. 
- Reminds me of [[Rework]] in that it rethinks the #Software paradigm completely. Reminds me of modeling software programming as construction, where you want to build something that will last. 
- Love how they operate from principles and make their assumptions clear. That reminds me of [[Principles by Ray Dalio]]. This would be a great company to work for. 
- One critique I have is that data hoarding is a thing. How are they managing that? Do we really want to optimize to persist all #Data? Or is there some data we could do without? Is it good that some data goes away?
> Formats and standards disintegrate in 5 years or less. Data is turned to dust every day.
> Our passion is to prove information doesn't have to be this way.

## Assumptions / Principles
1.  **We are complexity bigots.** We don’t merely hate complexity in software—we detest it. Fussy code decreases its durability. It forces users to alter habits for no reason. Clutter makes code obsolete before it's finished and it makes it impossible to adapt. Complexity creates user problems, it introduces bugs, and decreases performance. It's also expensive. Simplicity is the one and only future.
    
2.  **We say no to feature requests.** We love our customers. We would do most anything for them. But we don’t do everything for them. Including many feature requests. You pay us to create software that you can depend on. Our job is to find the features that meet that standard. And exclude those that don't. We work hard to pick the features we roll into our core experience. And we are fussier about which features we leave out. The best upgrade is the one not done, in our view.
    
3.  **Bells and whistles are somebody else’s job.** Saying no is so hard that we have built an entire culture around enabling others to build in their own functions as they see fit. Our extensions program lets any competent developer build and sell, if they so choose, their own add-ons to the platform.

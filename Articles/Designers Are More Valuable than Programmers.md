This article was written by [[Shawn Crowley]] of #AtomicObject and it talks about the primacy of #Design in a #Spin post.

## Learning
- With comments and emails, write in another spot (plain text editor) edit, then reply. 
- How do you determine the line for stopping engaging? 
	- Gut thing but tone and persistence are good to watch. If you try to calm them down and shape the conversation and the conversation changes, then keep going. If your efforts have no effect on the trajectory of the conversation, then dip. 
	- This applies to conversations as well. For face to face, the goal is to bring down the level of emotion. Sometimes, if things are escalating without any sign of slowing, it's often helpful to shut it down for a time. 
- #Levers 
	- Long term relationships incentivize respectful conversations. 
		- This is why our ability to have good conversations with strangers online is limited. 
		- Staying colocated will help this as well, part of the reason we aren't going remote. 
			- Remote companies become less of a teach & learn mentality and more mercenary like. Works if there isn't tons of learning going on and people can go rogue and do great development. Great for post product market fit. 
			- Works well to differentiate #AtomicObject - reminds me of picking something to disagree with from [[Rework]].
		- Relates to #Politics because at some point, politicians stopped living in DC. This made them disconnected from reach other and eroded their common ground and common goals. 

## Reflections
- What impressed me most here was the comments and how Shawn handled dissent so well. He was able to own the fact that this article title was clickbait, yet also stand by his points. 
- His argument is basically that design is behind every good work, from entrepreneurship (finding product market fit) to developers (helps define requirements and make things easy to use)
- This point feels like an anti- #Levers. 
	> Programmers must satisfy the definition of the rules and standards defined by business thinkers and designers. Programmers know they will probably get the vision wrong. Programmers sometimes blame designers and business stakeholders for not being able to define the requirements concretely enough to succeed.
	> Programmers must also satisfy the rules of the technology platform they are using to codify the product vision. Designers have created the language and development toolset used by programmers.
- This is a helpful definition to strive for as I begin work. Design is becoming more and more attractive as a part of my toolkit:
	> I like to call programmers who bring a design mindset to their work, “developers” or “makers.”

## Quotes
> **Ultimately, design is what drives business rules and software requirements.**
> A programmer codifies the vision of designers into a technology platform that will deliver a product or service to end consumers.
> I suspect developers confuse designers as artists and that pushes developers’ creativity more strongly into the technical realm.
> I encourage developers to view user-centered design as a systematic process that includes readily learnable practices. Design is not art or magic.

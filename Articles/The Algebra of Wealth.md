## Ideas:
- Fascinating take on the #Stock craziness with #Gamestop and #Reddit
>  Reddit mainly inspired a transfer of wealth from one hedge fund to others. It was a pump and dump masquerading as a movement … with many retail investors left holding the bag. There was a conspiracy behind it, though: Society has conspired for decades, through low interest rates, tax policy, and most recently the stimulus, to transfer wealth from the young to the old

- A useful definition of #Rich / #Wealth:
> Rich is having passive income greater than your burn.
> People on a path to #Money focus on their earnings; people on a path to wealth also focus on their burn

- #Levers:
	> Anyway, it’s not your income, but your income-to-expense ratio, that determines if you’re rich.
	> My observation is that there are four factors in the algebra of wealth: focus, stoicism, time, and diversification.
- Great advice to maximize your earnings: "People who tell you to follow your passion are already rich: Follow your talent."
- An interesting note on sector: 
	> Sector dynamics will trump your talent (I realize how awful that sounds). However, someone of average talent at Google has done better over the last decade than someone great at General Motors

- Fascinating point about the #Economics of #Marriage: 
> Married people grow their net worth [77 percent](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249674022_Marriage_and_Divorces_Impact_on_Wealth) more than single people. Marry the right person, and then invest in that relationship every day. You’ve wagered 50 percent-plus of your net worth, and value in the marketplace, on that partnership. Don’t keep score, and bring forgiveness, generosity, and engagement. In sum, show up.
- Why?

> The most powerful forward-looking indicator of your financial freedom is not how much you earn, but how much you save.

- The power of #CompoundInterest: 
> Compounding is not just a financial thing. The most important returns in life come from the compounded effects of our investments over time, whether in our finances, careers, hobbies, or relationships. Change the timescale of your life, and you change your life.

- #Investing advice:
> Most of my major mistakes in investing can be distilled down to two things: not diversifying, and trading.
> In the end, my kevlar has been not allocating more than 10 percent of my net worth to any one investment.


## Reflections
- The best thing I can probably do for myself now is to build cheap habits. Running and walking are two, as opposed to skiing or boating. The project with [[Neil]] is also cheap and provides abundant compounding interest over time.

## Idea
- The amount of work you can do is more about how much energy you have than how much time you have. Thus, it's super important to make sure you are replenishing energy because without it, you can't do anything even if you have time. Thus [[03062021 - Levers]] you should focus on are activities that: 
	- Provide energy (high priority - like running)
	- Do a lot with a little energy (reading? not sure I have a great example)
	- Take a while but don't take much energy (chopping wood)
- Similarly, you should avoid activities that: 
	- Take lots of energy in short periods of time (unless they are highly productive)

Thinking this way probably results in very different decisions about how you might spend your time. All of a sudden something that takes a long time but requires little energy isn't as bad of a decision as you think and something that takes a lot of energy but sucks (lunch with someone you don't like) is much worse that you thought. 

Prioritizing energy management results in a totally new way of looking at the world.

## Example
- When I get to the end of a work day at [[Atomic Object]] I'm often worn out and get nothing done after work even though I have tons of time. Why? Because my energy is gone (often because of [[202105051112 - Self control is a limited quantity]] and the fact I use lots of self control to work).

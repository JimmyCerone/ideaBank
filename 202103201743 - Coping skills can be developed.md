## Idea
- This idea is from [[How Bad Do You Want It? by Matt Fitzgerald]] and was groundbreaking for me. Through anecdotes and #Science research, he showed that we can develop specific coping skills (like bracing) that improve our ability to deal with the world. One of the interesting things that came out of that is the idea that [[202103201742 - Coping skills are generalizeable]], which almost makes me want to run again. I could become a more patient, present person by running. I can learn skills like that through experience by putting myself in challenging situations and seeing how much of the firewalk I can endure. 

## Connections
- One important note here is that [[03132021 - Success is slow]]. The coping skills can be developed, but only over #Time and with lots of #Pain 
- [[202103120949 - Nothing fails like success]] - a lot of the athletes who developed coping skills did so because they had to - they had previously gotten by without them. Developing them was so hard because their #Physical fitness allowed them to avoid coping well in the past because they didn't need to. 
- I wonder if [[202103171233 - Add habits one at a time]] applies here? Should you develop one at a time? Do they build on each other?

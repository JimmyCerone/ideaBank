## Context
- What's interesting about this idea is that in the past, the East was the #Economics superpower. You see it in [[Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World]] and elsewhere. In [[The Elephant and the Dragon by Robyn Meredith]] I was introduced to the idea that this will once again be the reality, and soon. 

## Connections
- I'm fascinated by the intersection between this idea and [[202103181952 - Some economies will near zero growth]]. 
- From the United States and other Western Nations perspectives, this is an example of [[03132021 - Bad things happen slowly]]. The drift away from strong #Economics #Growth and #Education has been slow but consistent. An example of [[03182021 - Compound Growth]] and #FeedbackLoop. 

## Questions
- What will happen as #Western economies near zero #Growth?

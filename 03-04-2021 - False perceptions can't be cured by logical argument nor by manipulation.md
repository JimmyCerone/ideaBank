- The author of #LovesExecutioner struggles with his patient who refuses to open 3 letters about his time at an institute for research. The scientist is sure because of [[03-04-2021 - False perceptions of other's perceptions of you can trap you]] that the letters will crush him. The author can't get the scientist to open the letters.

In the end, the scientist heard from another source (other than the letters) that everything was ok.

## Idea
- An idea that is counter intuitive yet quickly verifiable. Fascinating. 

## Example
- Still need to do more thinking here, I think I run into this a lot with [[Liv Panozzo]] and [[Neil]] as well as my parents. I think in my frenzy of ideas I forget to process and then tell people worrying, half baked ideas that are so unclear they create fear about my next decisions.

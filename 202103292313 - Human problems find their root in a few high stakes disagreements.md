## Context
- Comes from [[Crucial Conversations]], whose these is basically that since all the high #Risk interactions in #Relationships come from disagreements, if you can optimize the disagreements, then you can fix the relationships. 

## Reflection
- I disagree with this idea and am more sympathetic to the idea expressed in [[7 Principles of a Successful Marriage]], which is that what matters most is respect and affinity, which are built over many tiny interactions. Even if you nail the big interactions, if you fail in the small ones you are going to fail. That said, there is a place for improving communication as [[Nonviolent Communication]] argues as well. Not bad to know these things but not the key they make them out to be.

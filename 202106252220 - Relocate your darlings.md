## Idea
- Many writers, including Stephen King in his [[On Writing by Stephen King]], say to kill your darlings. I've always struggled with this and the advice didn't feel quite right. So there are two approaches Kleon recommends: 
	- Relocate them to a google doc you "will" check later. You are deleting them and they are still there but you can let go of them
	- Delete everything but your darling and restart with that as the kernel. 
		- This seems to me the most innovative approach and essentially what I did when writing, "Know Your Nature" at the [[Oregon Extension]]. 


## Connections
- In an odd way, I think this is deeply tied to futurism and the idea that [[202105031552 - The future is unbelievable now and what's believable now isn't the future]]. I have to wonder if our darlings are the kenrals are something unbelievable to us and we should chase it, rather than what we can predictably call "good"

## Example
- When I wrote Knowing Your Nature in Oregon and threw almost of all of it out to restart on a tiny kernel.

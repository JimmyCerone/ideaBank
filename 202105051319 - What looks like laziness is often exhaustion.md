## Reflections
- I am stunned by this idea and so surprised I didn't think of it earlier. Connects deeply with [[202105051703 - We aren't limited by time we are limited by energy]] and [[Making decisions is hard]] / [[202105051112 - Self control is a limited quantity]]. 

## Example
- Totally explains why I'm so tired at work. I was not using my [[03062021 - Levers]] well and was constantly bleeding energy making decisions about who should pair when and when and how to work. The solution for me was [[202105041057 - Timers decrease decision fatigue]]. But it's best to keep an eye on in myself and others in the future. An uncommon and subtle idea that leads me to drastically different conclusions than most other people.

Functional #Pain helps you understand your #Physical limits while unecessary pain is the result of damaged #Nerve endings. 

This reminds me of chats I've had with [[Aaron Reider]] and I think the same applies to #Psychology. There is some psychological pain that is functional, that serves a purpose. But much of mine is vestigal, it is the result of damage over time that no longer serves any purpose. 

I want to work on implementing this idea more often in my daily life, differentiating what pains have purpose and what don't.

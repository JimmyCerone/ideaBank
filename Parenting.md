## Ideas
- when kids get a gift, they donate something they don't need. 
- Have a "dumb" phone that can only call that you can always be reached at and give only your family the number. Perhaps even consider having this in the next 5 years.
- Watch inside out with your kids
- Have a place for your kids thatâ€™s theirs. They can paint it change it, rebuild it

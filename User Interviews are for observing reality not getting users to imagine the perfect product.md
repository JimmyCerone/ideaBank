## Context
- Was reading about this for Kim's design conversation at #Work.

## Reflection
- I always thought that user interviews were for coming up with crazy off the wall #Ideas with users. In reality, the focus is much more on observing how they use a product to gain insights for how to #Design it better. 

## Example
- Instead of asking someone about their ideal todo #Software, observe them while using another software and note when they are frustrated or have trouble doing something necessary. 

## Connections
- Reminds me of the [[Shared realities with different interpretations]] concept from [[Love's Executioner]] because the goal of a user interview is to get inside someone's head and better understand their needs. As the author of the book points out, this is impossible since we think in images and communicate in words. 

## Questions
- Has anyone ever done user interviews while watching an fMRI scan of someone's brain?

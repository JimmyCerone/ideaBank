Lost Opportunity Cost
- Why it doesn't make sense to pay off your home

#Hiring
- You ask high then hope for someone that hits your critical parts
- At Hope there is a hiring #Questions Committee
	- Equal representation between men & women, white & non-white. Style is included on the dance committee
	- Plus you have to have someone from outside the department
	- #Scheduling this is hard. 
- Committee forms the requirements then the application is put out
	- The requirements vary by department. Publishing doesn't matter in dance, choreographic work does matter.
	- Dance is hard to apply to because you have to have academic chops (good writing quality + thinkers) but they also have to have a professional career. Then you have to have teaching chops on top of that. 
		- Triple whammy.
	- Committee meets and sifts through 35-40 applications. 
		- First run through is filtering out not qualified candidates
		- Second round is 30 - you have to then bring this down enough to 10-12 to interview
			- References and teaching creds make sense
			- How are they going to contribute to the culture? 
		- Third round is the #Interview. 
			- Check on culture, will they add to us - can they thrive at Hope? 
			- Artistic philosophy is a part of this. 
			- Some people differ from their philosophies & written materials
		- Final round is 3 - bring them to campus.

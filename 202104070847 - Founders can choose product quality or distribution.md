From [[202103291336 - The Episode of Everything - Balaji on Bitcoin]]. A kind of depressing idea that makes me curious about different ways to hack it (could you hire out a separate company to do one of these? Is this what Atomic does?). 

Basically the idea is that you have two [[03062021 - Levers]] when it comes to a product: 

1. Quality
2. Distribution

Both are equally hard and require equal amounts of time so you have to sacrifice one or the other. 

## Example

- Balaji's central claim was that newspapers have great distribution with a terrible product (he hates the media). Not sure I agree with this but an interesting example nonetheless. 


## Connections
- I'm drawn to a connection to the [[Black Swan by Nassim Taleb]] with the distribution side especially. I think this is less about quality and more about luck.

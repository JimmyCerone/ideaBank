I think this idea from [[202103291336 - The Episode of Everything - Balaji on Bitcoin]] aligns with work I'm doing with [[Limit my consumption of books and articles]] and my conversation with [[Liv Panozzo]]. I'm making a bad #Assumptions about #Learning, in that I think information is the most important thing. It's probably the most fun thing, but it's the wrong [[03062021 - Levers]] to pull. 

Levers: 
1. Process 
2. Information

Information as a lever is stupid because it's basically unlimited. The process is more important because it influences the quality and retention of the information you put together. Information has further sub levers here: [[202103261011 - Knowledge management depends on reads and writes]].

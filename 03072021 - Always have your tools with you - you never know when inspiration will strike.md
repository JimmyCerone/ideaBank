## Context
- I first came across this idea in [[Shoot Me While I'm Happy - Memories from the Tap Goddess of the Lower East Side by Jane Goldberg]], but I think it applies everywhere. 


## Reflection
- I'm not sure how I'd apply this in #Computer stuff, though bringing my computer along in my backpack (or at least buying a crappy chrome book) could be a good start. I like the idea though, always being ready to perform or #Teach. 
- There is something magical in demonstrations, as shown by plenty of #Design techniques, including [[Design Thinking Toolkit, Lesson 8 - Difficulty and Importance Matrix]], which gives you a #Visualizaton of features and [[Use stories to break down complicated ideas]] - stories I think are a form of #Visualizaton as well. Being able to bring things to life, always having the basic tools to do so, seems invaluable to me.

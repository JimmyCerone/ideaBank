Taking #Responsibility is good, but telling someone else to is almost never good (see Haddie in [[Parenthood]]). 

For some reason, plastic companies (see here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fiu9GSOmt8E) and gun companies (see [[Lethal Passage - The Story of a Gun by Erik Larson]]) manage to do this. 

This idea shows up in a more insidious way in [[Black Power and Black Theology by James Cone]] where white society blames black people for being in #Poverty, when that poverty is a policy choice made by a white democracy.

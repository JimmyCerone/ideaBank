## Context
 - [[The Wright Brothers by David]] talked about this. It reminds me of the thinking styles from [[Black Swan by Nassim Taleb]] and [[Principles by Ray Dalio]] (uncorrelated #Risk). 
 - The Wright Brothers said that:
 > "The man who wishes to keep at the problem long enough to really learn anything positively must not take dangerous #Risk s"

## Questions
- How can [[Neil]] and I apply this? How can I? How does one start thinking like this?

## Idea
- You can model and even visualize habits as viruses, which is a possibility [[The Power of Habits by Charles Duhigg]] didn't consider but [[The Emperor of All Maladies by Siddartha Mukherjee]] did in the discussion of smoking. 
## Connections
- I think the best explanation of this idea comes from the combination of [[Switch - How to Change Things When Change is Hard by Dan and Chip Heath]] & [[The Righteous Mind by Jonathon Haidt]]. What's weird to me is that I think lots of things work like viruses. It's a fairly common way to model things that I think [[Growth by Vaclov Smil]] touches on as well. Certainly bears more thinking and maybe even a whole book dedicated to learning about that type of growth because it probably indicates an alteration to the [[03062021 - Levers]]. Could connect deeply with what [[Russell]] and [[Neil]] and I talked about and would give us lots of mathematical modeling... Huh..
- Kind of concerning when you consider [[202105031534 - Habits are unconscious and form unconsciously]]. 
## Example
- Smoking spread throughout the US in the 40's and 50's in a similar way to an epidemic. So did drug usage in [[Dopesick by Beth Macy]].

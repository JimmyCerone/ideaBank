## Idea
- The tools used by a power structure will never be the tools that take it apart. 

## Connections
- Basically a different way of looking at [[Pedagogy of the Oppressed by Paolo Frieri]]. It cuts both ways. You can't reform a system from within a system nor can you use the same tools to create a new system (it will end up the same)
- This idea underlies [[202104211317 - Inductive reasoning is often misused when addressing systemic problems]]. When you use inductive reasoning, you ignore the problem with the tools themselves because you assume they "work". 
	- [[202105262338 - Behaviorism]] assumes that we are deterministic and that what is will be. 
		- I have thought about this before with my own habits, in saying that everything is about the cost of doing vs. not doing. I'm realizing it's not that simple. 

## Example
- The specific case here is the use of rewards in [[Punished by Rewards by Alfie Kohn]]. You can't reward your way out of the oppressive system we have today because the rewards are fundamentally conservative and preserve the system.

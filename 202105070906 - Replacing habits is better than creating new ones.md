## Idea
- Erasing cues from the [[202105071241 - Habit Loop]] is super hard because it is stored in the oldest part of our brain. Those cues stick around even when we aren't conscious ([[202105031534 - Habits are unconscious and form unconsciously]]). Thus, the best way to change a habit is to replace an existing one (though we are often unaware of these so the first step is recognizing we have a habit at all).

## Example
- [[Liv Panozzo]]'s therapist had her do this with food cravings. Super interesting to see it pop up here. I'm sure [[Aaron Reider]] has talked to me about this as well.

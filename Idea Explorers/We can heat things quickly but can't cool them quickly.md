#Problem: We can heat things quickly but can't cool them quickly

Currently cooling air specifically is energy intensive and time consuming. 
- We see this in cars, freezers, and more because air is a terrible conductor. 
	- Might be a basic physics problem that doesn't have a good solution

## Solution
- A stove for cooling things

## Benefits
- Ice cream
- Lots of unexpected benefits
	- Would be a huge leap forward, almost basic research [[The Idea Factory]] esque. 
	
	
## Questions
- What could you do with this?

#Problem: Writers opinions evolve over time but old posts don't give context

Partly connected to [[We only see writers once they are good]] in that we can sometimes see writers when they are at their worst without knowing whether or not they updated their views. 

Solution: 
- Tool that surfaces old posts for you to update and/or respond to keep your views up to date and avoid leaving hurtful #Ideas out on the #Internet. 
	- While I came up with this idea in light of [[Basecamp]] posts that were quasi #Racist, I think it could also help people update what they've learned. Reminds me of Scott Alexander and his idea that [[You can write about things you don't understand yet]] - plus his article about what he learned in the 2010s.

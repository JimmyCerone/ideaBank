#Problem: Keeping up with old friends is hard

Solution:
- list of friends on iPhone that gets prioritized by who you last called. 
	- Uses data from calls or overlay the call app to keep a running list. Could also pull data from messages. 

MVP: Randomizer that you give a list of contacts to and it spits out a random person to call.

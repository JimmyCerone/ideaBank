#Problem: Grass is terrible for the environment

- 1/3 of our water use goes to grass

## Solution
- Moss lawns
- Fake grass (Las Vegas)
- [[Xeriscape]] (rocks and other stuff - big in New Mexico)
- Short grasses 
	- To avoid the cost of mowing
- Not mowing - [[The Overstory]]
- Using space to grow gardens and flowers (using more productive things than grass)

## Fun Fact
- Grass was originally a sign of the rich since it signaled they didn't need to grow food.

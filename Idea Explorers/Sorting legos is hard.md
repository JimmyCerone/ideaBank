#Problem: Sorting legos is hard

## Solution
- Lego hopper that sorts them out into kits that you can sell or helps you reassemble a kit whose parts got jumbled. 
	- Works because legos are expensive. 


## Questions
- How hard would it be to sort by size? By color? Is only one of those valuable? 
- How much would the machine cost? 
- Could it handle non legos?

#Problem: Car sales are male dominant

## Solution: 
- Car dealerships with salespeople of both genders OR a woman owned and operated car dealership
- OR a car dealership that specializes in not being assholes to women
	- Women have more and more purchasing power and traditional car dealerships don't cater well to them in general. So there's an opportunity here. 
- The idea is that this would make more folks more comfortable buying.


## Story 
- [[Bo Jack]] ride sharing app shows the risk in this. Our society is just pretty screwed up no matter what.

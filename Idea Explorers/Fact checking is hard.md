#Problem: Fact checking is hard

## Solution
- #AI that comes articles and attempts to find and validate sources.
	- Like an automated version of Snopes.com

## Questions
- What if the internet is flooded with fake sources? Can you build a credible story by faking tons of stuff?

## Connections
- A sub problem of this is #Consistency, [[Writers opinions evolve over time but old posts don't give context]]. Checking how someone speaks over time is one way to fact check

## Reflection
- The more I consider this problem, the more I wonder if it's even useful to fact check at all given that [[03-04-2021 - False perceptions can't be cured by logical argument nor by manipulation]]. As I learned in [[The Righteous Mind by Jonathon Haidt]], the problem of incorrect facts is more #Emotional (at least that's why folks don't fact check)
- Negatively weighting posts that are false can have a positive influence. 
	- With a #System like this, you could more towards removal. 
- On further reflection, facts within an #Article are important. It is useful to validate facts whether people use the facts or not. So this is still useful even if people don't use it to determine #Truth. 
- This could improve #Trust in #Newspapers and reduce the incidence of #FakeNews because it would hold people accountable.

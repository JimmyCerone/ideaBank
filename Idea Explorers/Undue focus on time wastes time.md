#Problem: Undue focus on time wastes time

- This is a subtle problem in that the clock is not the problem, there's an underlying problem which is constantly checking the status of something. 
	- Checking the time too often is one manifestation of this, but it would be just like the Amway example where the problem isn't time, it's progress being constantly checked. 


## Solution
- #Kickstarter / #Workshop idea: the twice tolling clock
	- #PhysicalProduct 

MVP: Arduino. 

Kind of this idea when we focus on time: https://medium.com/jimmys-ten-cents/the-power-of-paradoxical-intention-e0ed167aba4f


## Connections
- First discovered in [[Black Swan by Nassim Taleb]]
- There was a twice tolling clock in [[A Gentleman in Moscow by Amor Towles]]

## Example
- Matt from Amway continually checking in about the status of a story slows down development because you spend so much time reporting your status that there is less leftover for work time. 
	- We do this to ourselves by checking status via the clock all the time which takes away from progress.

#Problem: Silence is difficult to find 

Silence has a few forms:
- Lack of physical noise (auditory)
- Lack of brain stimulation ([[The Information - A History, A Theory, A Flood by james Gleick]]) / [[The Signal and the Noise - Why So Many Predictions Failâ€”But Some Don't by Nate Silver]]
- White noise can be silent
	- In some ways change is a form of noise

- All different contexts for this problem:
	- In the office, especially in open offices. 
	- Cities with their traffic

- A few effects 
	- Makes [[040820211016 - Deep Work]] hard. 
	- Makes reflection and meditation challenging
		- Jimmy had this when he first got his dog
	- Makes silence scary when you do find it.

The benefits of silence:
- Slows life down ([[Neil]] on trail learned this)


## Connections
- This is part of the problem with [[202104200859 - Chat is a greedy form of communication]] which is touched on in [[The End of Absence - Reclaiming What We've Lost in a World of Constant Connection by Michael Harris]]

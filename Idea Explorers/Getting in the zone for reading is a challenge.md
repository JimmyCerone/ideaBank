#Problem: Getting in the zone for reading is a challenge

- The problem is well elaborated here: [[The Erosion of Deep Literacy]]. 

## Solution
- Create scenarios where time isn't a concern and your options are limited
	- Cut out internet, cut out tech, cut off TV.
	- Seems like more of a [[The Power of Habits by Charles Duhigg]] type of thing than a product.
		- Could be something that people pay for - a place where they can recreate this environment and do [[040820211016 - Deep Work]]. 
		- If there were a place you knew you could do this and a place you knew you could get distraction. Increase the lambda / difference between rooms. So amp up the distraction in one room (have a TV there and it be the centerpiece) to magnify the "void" of the other room.

## Questions
- What are places we have good reading experiences? 
	- Airplanes, waiting rooms, cars
		- Lots of travel
- What are the [[03062021 - Levers]] that make those good locations?
	- Time
		- Time cannot be optimized
		- How do we create situations like this in our daily lives?
	- Lack of options	
		- You can't do many things while killing an unspecified amount of time
	- Shape the Path - [[Switch - How to Change Things When Change is Hard by Dan and Chip Heath]]
		- White noise from jet engines or cars going by or limited space

#Problem: Notes apps dont let you stack notes

Why is this a problem?
- Neil has physical sticky #Notes on his wall
- Different things are contingent on each other

Kind of like Joe's #MindMapping exercise - you have to do things in order. 

You either get lots of notes that should be connected but aren't (you lose things in the cracks)

Most todos are sequential, not unrelated. 

Notes apps assume all things are separate and unrelated.

#Todo 

Reservation is that the notes app space is so crowded already.

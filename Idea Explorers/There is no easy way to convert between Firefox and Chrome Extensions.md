#Problem: There is no easy way to convert between Firefox and #ChromeExtension 

## Solution: 

- Custom conversions
- Converter that ports code over
- Steal ideas from Chrome and implement them on Firefox
	- While doing this, we [[202105101942 - Sell your byproducts]] by offering to convert other chrome extensions.


## Questions
- How do we find Chrome extensions to do this?
	- Won't be the huge chrome extensions (they will have everything) but the mid level ones that leave profit on the table but have decent traffic on chrome

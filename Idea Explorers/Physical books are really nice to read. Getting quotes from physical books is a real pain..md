#Problem: Physical #Book are really nice to read. Getting quotes from physical books is a real pain.

## Solution: 
- Have some kind of camera system (Maybe just thru a phone camera?) and some sort of pointer (either an LED pen or even just a finger?) and you can trace the quote you want, and the system automatically adds the quote the the database. The system could also get the sentence or two before it (that is one of my peeves about the kindle. sometimes it is hard to get the first word of the sentence/ you lose context.) it could also automatically record some of the meta data from the page. If the metadata was not there, it could ask for a picture of the cover/ have manual inputs. 

## Questions
- Why doesn't this exist?
	- It's easy to convert text to digital form. Is the hard part targeting the text? Is it not valuable enough to create? Is there a market?
	- Is the hard part the camera and it's location?
	- Is it that we have all the parts but putting them together is awkward?
		- Could we 3D print something to help? #PhysicalProduct 
- What are people already doing? 


## Use Cases
- Super nice for college students going through a textbook and making notes
	- This would make for a nice exit - selling to a note taking company

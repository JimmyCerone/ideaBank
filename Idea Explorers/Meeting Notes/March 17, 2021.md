## Reflection on Reddit Post (https://www.reddit.com/r/CrazyIdeas/comments/m2t8h6/a_calendar_based_budget_that_helps_you_visualize/)
- With the #Calendar #Idea we are seeing a weird [[03062021 - Levers]] situation. 
	- People who care about #Money use #Budgeting #Apps and are satisfied with them. 
		- #Assumptions : The #Personality that likes to budget also likes tried and true solutions, like spreadsheets. They also like to think the world is predictable, which it isn't, which is the main flaw of budgets (at least as people use them now). 
			- Budgets are "Predictable" in part because they build in extra fat to be predictable. They #Anchor. 
				- Two problems:
					- Anchor high and stay artificially high
					- Anchor low and bust (or it's unsustainable)
						- Could be wrong about "low"
	- People who are open to thinking differently don't care about money?

## Reflections
### Calendar
- Almost too little effort per day
	- Once a week could increase the effort level and make this better 
- Can we automate this? Could we take in a transaction log as a csv and spit something out?

### How Often Do You Think About It?
- The app is useful as a silo for purchase based thinking without the immediate pressure to buy (like a wish list)
	- This info could get lost on a todo list and there's pressure to buy on a wish list
- Might circle back around to this with #Nocode 
	- #Nocode would have greatly improved this solution by removing the limits of the UI. 
- Widgets and 3D touch could take this to the next level
	- Permanently have this on the home screen to make it top of mind and easy to increment

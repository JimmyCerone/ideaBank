#Problem: Paint is permanent and our taste is changeable

## Problem
- Sort of an odd corollary of [[202103261112 - The future is inherently unpredictable]] and [[202103261111 - Humans are terrible predictors]]


## Solution
- Color changing paint
- Cheap paint
- Easy to remove wallpaper
- Modular walls / wall covers
- Paint that you don't need to tape
- Tapestry
- [[VR & AR]] could blow this out of the water, but it would require wearing goggles all the time

Two types of solutions that use different [[03062021 - Levers]]:
- Lower switching cost
- Make painting itself easier
	- OR
- Time vs. Money cost

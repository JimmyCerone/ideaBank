#Problem: There seems to be little utilization of #AI in #Budgeting

Solution: 
- A tool that takes in a #CSV of your transactions and spits out recommendations

- Automated #WizardOfOz 

- Label "good" budget and a bad budget with some basic rules around it. 

  - You input the rules then it spits out a bunch of budgets for you. 

  - Use #API in the background to inform this.

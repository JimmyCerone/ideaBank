#Problem: Music is challenging to explore

## Problems

- Part of this is a human problem as music is part of how we identify with groups ([[The Righteous Mind by Jonathon Haidt]] & [[Tribe - On Homecoming and Belonging by Sebastian Junger]]) and part of this is because most music platforms make money from catering to us, not helping us find new music ([[Spotify]]). 
- Music is also deeply ingrained in our habits ([[The Power of Habits by Charles Duhigg]]) and thus is hard to explore
	- Fundamentally about change - [[Switch - How to Change Things When Change is Hard by Dan and Chip Heath]]
- [[03062021 - Levers]] for finding new music:
	- Deep
		- Do a deep dive into a new genre and spend a lot of time with it.
			- This would be like listening to the music while you read the lyrics. How [[Neil]] learns new music
			- This is hard in the same way that [[Getting in the zone for reading is a challenge]]
	- Broad
		- Listen a bunch of times - "shallow listens"
			- Basically what happens on the radio


## Benefits 
- Exploring music can expose you to new cultures and create connections between #Community 

## Solutions
- Have a playlist that slowly moves from familiar to unfamiliar music
	- or sandwiches them
- Make a "queue" like [[Pocket]] for music that makes it easy to archive.


## Questions
- Why is [[Spotify]] so bad at this? Tastebreakers goes against all of this.
- How did radio stations do this?

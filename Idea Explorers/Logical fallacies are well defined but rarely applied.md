#Problem: Logical fallacies are well defined but rarely applied

## Solution
- #ChromeExtension  that checks the logical components of a statement and runs them through some type of analysis. 

## Connections
- Kind of a similar problem to [[It's hard to keep track of your assumptions for a product]] because it's hard to know what you don't know and hard to understand someone else's intent, in part because [[We live in biased bubbles]]. 

## Risks
- How hard is this to pull off? 
- Would it be useful for self reflection or would it simply be weaponized? 
- What biases does this build in? What about things that are outside of logic? 
- Does this incentivize less thinking?

## Solution: 

- Throttle usage a bit and then allow the user to play a game to boost the speed

## Connections 
- Kind of connected to lots of control related problems on the terminal like [[Even if you resolve an error on the terminal on the terminal, it's easy to forget how]] & [[Even if you resolve an error on the terminal on the terminal, it's easy to forget how]]. 
- Directly connected to [[Build times take a while and you have to wait]].

#Problem: The tabs at the far end of the browser draw an inordinate amount of attention (tabs aren't evenly distributed in importance)

The idea is that the importance and the amount of attention given to a tab is not evenly distributed. 

Right now, importance and amount of attention aren't necessarily the same. So if you have an unimportant distracting thing in a high attention tab, it disrupts your work flow. 


[[03062021 - Levers]]: 
- Icon
	- Icons like [[Netflix]] are more attention grabbing than more important things like [[Microsoft]] Outlook. 
- Importance
	- Amount of importance for the task at hand
- Location
	- Far right and left are highest attention locations


## Solution: 

- You can either use this to decrease distraction by keeping most important tabs there (forcing you to prioritze like you might in physical space). This is one of the problems with a 2D workspace - it's like having a desk with papers piled all over each other. Having the most important tab on the end would be like keeping the most important paper out of the clutter.

- You can also increase distraction and draw your attention to a journal or something positive at the end of the browser. 


## Connections
- Deeply connected to my many ideas about [[Uneven Distribution]]

## Experiment
- Use eye tracking software to better understand the above levers.

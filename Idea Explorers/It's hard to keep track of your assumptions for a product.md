#Problem: It's hard to keep track of your assumptions for a product

This problem is #Solved but not implemented. 

I think there are a few levers that keep the solution from being implemented: 
- [[03062021 - Levers]]
	- When the assumption is identified
		- Often this happens afterwards. We don't realize we were making the assumption until after it fails
			- Monthly product assumption was hazy until it failed and then it was crystal clear. It would have been hard to identify in advance what assumption we were testing. Often the most important assumptions are silent because [[202103261112 - The future is inherently unpredictable]] & [[202103261111 - Humans are terrible predictors]]
			- Sometimes we are in complex adaptive situations that are hard to model well enough to test assumptions.
			- Sometimes we also don't even think of things ([[Coded Bias]] or [[Weapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O'Neil]])

## Solution
- [[Microsoft]] Excel or [[Google]] sheets solves the technical problem. The other problem is harder to solve. The problem is either human laziness or complex adaptive and it's hard to parse out what type of problem is being faced, which leads to us doing nothing because [[202105051423 - What looks like resistance is often a lack of clarity]].

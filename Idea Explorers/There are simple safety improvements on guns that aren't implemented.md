#Problem: There are simple safety improvements on guns that aren't implemented

Solution: 

- Take the impossible foods approach - make a safer gun that people will voluntarily choose to protect their families. 
	 - Implement the solutions from [[Lethal Passage - The Story of a Gun by Erik Larson]].
- Make something that keeps people safe without killing potential. 
	- How do we deal with the symbolic nature of the gun? [[There is little data on hand in the gun purchase process from dealer to buyer]] shows that it's not neatly fit in the capitalist structure and exists somewhere outside of it. 

## Questions
- Could benefit from [[Switch - How to Change Things When Change is Hard by Dan and Chip Heath]] around [[202105051417 - Aiming at the Elephant gives motivation but no direction]] & [[202105051416 - Aiming at the Rider gives direction but not motivation]]. 
	- I think in the past people argue about gun control from either the rider or the elephant's perspective, missing either motivation or direction. Finding a way to meld these would be huge.

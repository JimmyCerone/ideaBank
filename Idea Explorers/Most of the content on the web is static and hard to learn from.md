#Problem: Most of the content on the web is static and hard to learn from

      

## Solution: 

- Learner side tools that transform static text into engaging content.
- #ChromeExtension that makes flashcards out of wikipedia pages
- [[AI]] takes a [[Wikipedia]] and translates into different mediums (audio, visual, etc) -> [[Matter]] does this to an extent (text to audio)
	- [[IBM]] Watson can take in information and synthesize it
		- Turn these into flashcards
			- How close does [[Blinkist]] come to this?

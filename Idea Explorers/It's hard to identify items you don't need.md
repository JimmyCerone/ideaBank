#Problem: It's hard to identify items you don't need

## Solution
- Companies tag an item with a red post it note. It gets moved to a set location and if it sits there for a year it gets tossed
	- Apply to your home


## Questions
- Can we virtually red tag items with #AR?
	- This would allow for interesting automation and reminders plus create interesting situations with places like [[Amazon]] or [[Ebay]] to let you sell your items.

#Problem: It's hard to find things to do in #Winter that don't cost #Money

Things like cross country skiing are costly to rent & buy. Jimmy misses the summer where he could just drive somewhere fun and enjoy it. The beach is free!

## Problems
- Low utilization 
	- You would buy expensive skiis but only be able to use them a couple of times. Kind of the same problem as having a boat - you can only use it at most half of the year
	- Low utilization because of snow availability (Gravity problem)
	- Low utilization due to things like #Work.
- High costs due to low volume
	- The skiis are just plain expensive. They are way more expensive than shoes. If skiis could be sold everywhere at all times they would be much cheaper because of economies of scale. 
- #Information Problem
	- There are some low cost options out there. It's hard to understand the difference between a good low cost option and a fleecing.
	- Knowledge problem in that some activities are unknown. In certain families it is well known how to ski or ice skate, but you have to learn how to do that. Even if you had the equipment, you wouldn't know how or where to use it. All this knowledge is stuck in little family clusters. The knowledge isn't easily publicly available. 
- Sunk Cost Problem / Accessories 
	- There is a high upfront cost to all these activities and there are many associated costs. To go downhill skiing you need a damn good coat, not just skiis and boots. 
- Winter
	- Winter is just hard. The weather could kill you, whereas in summer it probably won't. 
	- The consequences for bad equipment are much worse.

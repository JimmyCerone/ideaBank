#Problem: #Budgeting apps don't work for inconsistent incomes

They say they do, but they LIE.

Could you budget for the worst case scenario? 

How can you measure and quantify the amount of inconsistency? 
- Is it that I'm hourly and I work between 30-40 hours a week?
- Is it that I am a seasonal worker?
- Is it that I do odd jobs?
- Is it the printmobile problem? Comission?


Basically comes down to #Risk management techniques.

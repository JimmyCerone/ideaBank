#Problem: We don't do constructive feedback well

# Solution: 
- We write an article about how to actually help when people ask for feedback. Basically a reflection on how our chat with Matt Gira went. 	
	- Figure out what kind of help people want
	- Basically figure out what stage of the process they are at and give feedback accordingly. 
	- One way to slice this is to come at conversations like this from a change management perspective - like [[Switch - How to Change Things When Change is Hard by Dan and Chip Heath]].

## Examples
- When in the planning stage, you don't say, "This comma should be a period" because that paragraph might be thrown out anyway.
- When in the execution stage you don't say, "You should throw out the whole first page" because there is no time for that.

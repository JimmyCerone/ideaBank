#Problem: Leaves make lawns look bad

## Solution
- Don't use deciduous trees (comes with the downside of [[Roofs absorb heat at the wrong times]] b/c those trees help with heat)
- Automatic leaf raker (like an automatic grass mower)
	- Like a [[Roomba]].

## Connections
- Kind of an interesting connection to [[Lawn care is fragmented and time consuming]] & [[Grass is terrible for the environment]].

#Problem: #Clock can be detrimental to #Sleep

## Example
- Waking up at 3 am freaks you out because you know you shouldn't be awake, which makes you worry, which makes it harder to go back to sleep
	- Alternatively, you wake 30 minutes before your alarm and freak out. 
- Knowing the time, you stay up later and later because you calculate the hours of sleep you will _still_ get ([[Jimmy]]). 


## Solution
- Clock that during the night, displays "Awake" or "Asleep", telling you in a non freak out way what you should be doing.

We came upon this #RootProblem on [[2021-06-08]] when talking about [[It's hard to connect with people on large video calls]]. 

[[03062021 - Levers]] of Communication

	- Maximum: Time Capsule
- Proximity
	- Minimum: Colocated
	- Maximum: Edge of the Galaxy

## Connections
- [[The Information - A History, A Theory, A Flood by james Gleick]]
- [[202105131401 - Redundancy in a language can be measured]]

	- What would it look like to double down on high latency communication?
		- Time Capsules
			- Physical or Virtual

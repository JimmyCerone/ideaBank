#Problem: There is little data on hand in the gun purchase process from dealer to buyer

- It's hard to help the problem with guns if you have no idea who has them or who you sold them to. 
- Basically what we had at the time of publishing is a system that is completely paper based and disconnected with little oversight. 

## Connections 
- This is weird given [[202104050855 - Guns in America are treated like consumer products, not weapons]]. Whereas most consumer products are tracked mercilessly these aren't. Very weird given our #Capitalism and suggests that guns somehow exist both inside and outside of that system. 

#Gun #America 

## TODO
- [ ] Is this still accurate? Book was written in the 90's...

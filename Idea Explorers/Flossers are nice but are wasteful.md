#Problem: Flossers are nice but are wasteful

Solution: 
- Make a reusable flosser
- Door in Handle.
	- Handle contains spool of floss
	- Like a razor - you don't throw away the container but buy reusable spools

## Questions
- Why haven't reusable flossers been made? 
- Could we use UV to cleanse?
- How much cost reduction would the door and handle produce on the #Manufacturing side? 
	- Why hasn't this been attempted? Recurring revenue... Subscription model...

#Problem: #Money for #Schools  is silohed and can't go to the #Community

Pouring more money into the schools isn't always the answer. Sometimes by adding funding to the community you can improve schools indirectly, yet the funding doesn't work that way. It'd be interesting to have a more holistic vision of funding for the community. 

Solution: 

- General purpose funds that allow the city to allocate funds dynamically.

#Problem: Landlords are often predatory

## Solution
- Lease scanner that highlights important information
	- [[AI]] and #ComputerVision
- Landlord database that rates them like rate my professor
	- Why doesn't this exist?
- Cost aggregator
	- There are tons of add on costs that aren't reflected in the rent (pet fee, parking, etc)
	- Could this be a manual input tool? Like a simple dashboard for people to put their own information into? Would that be useful? 
		- Could we test this with a simple google form?

#Problem: You run out of food at different rates

## Context

At the moment, I've got 18 eggs, lots of salsa, but no chips or bread.

Causes food waste.

How do you shop in a way that normalizes these rates?

I think part of the problem here could be traced back to [[The Power of Habits by Charles Duhigg]]. We like to eat the same things over and over again, but we imagine that we will change our eating habits (eat more veggies or cook more from scratch). In reality, [[Switch - How to Change Things When Change is Hard by Dan and Chip Heath]] says change is hard. 

A few ways of looking at the problem: 
- Meals vs. Snacks
	- I think in terms of snacks (Eat hummus at 2X the rate of Salsa) [[HelloFresh]] solves for meals. 

## Solution: 

- Some tool that tracks the rate you buy things at then recommends how much to buy.
- Some tool that suggests recipes to normalize rate 
- #Solved by [[HelloFresh]] which gives you preportioned meals and by websites that take in ingredients and spit out recipes. 

## #Risk

- Behavior changes which makes this tough...
- There are an absurd number of [[03062021 - Levers]] here which makes this problem hard to solve
	- We could solve this from the grocery store side or make a physical product that changes how you shop or an #App that makes it hard to solve. 
	- A super smart fridge could make this feasible. It would also probably just solve the problem.

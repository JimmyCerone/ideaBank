#Problem: #Grocery #Stores are not #Wheelchair #Accessible

Solution:

- partner shoppers
- grabbers
- People shopping for you (https://www.shipt.com/)
	-  A solution but not the best one as this comes with increased cost and reduces control over shopping experience
- Redesigned grocery stores that are built to be accessible

#Problem: Lawn care is fragmented and time consuming

## Solution
- Reduce the switching cost [[03062021 - Levers]] and create a combo device (lawn mower edger weed wacker). 


## Risk
- Is the switching time the highest cost? Or are the tasks inherently time consuming? 
	- For smaller tasks like weed wacking and edging, yes. But probably not for lawn mowing. 
	- A complication is the different frequencies - you don't have to edge every time you mow your lawn.

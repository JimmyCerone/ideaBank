#Problem: Starting with problems leads us to seek over complicated solutions

- Based on the idea that [[202105291019 - The size of a problem and it's solution are asymmetrical]]. By starting with problems instead of looking for bright spots, we end up with bloated solutions. 

## Solution
- start with problems but then move to whatâ€™s already working instead of attempting to generate solutions. We can then build off of that instead of building from scratch, which is our main problem I think.

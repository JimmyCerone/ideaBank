#Problem: #Distractions can be helpful to get you through a tough problem, yet can also decrease #Productivity.

#Promising Idea

### Reflection

When dealing with hard problems, you often need to walk away to solve them. Yet figuring out what the right types of distractions are and how many of them you need is challenging. There seems to be a sweet spot, where a break helps you find new answers. Yet at a certain point the best thing for you is outside help. How do you tell the difference between a need to push through (with a few well timed distractions) and the need for help?

### Solutions
- Could you have software that monitors your computer activity and notices a pattern? Then suggests what to do? Take a break or ask for help?
	- #ChromeExtension would be interesting here.
- #Calendar rating system
	- If you rate the work you are doing as busy work, it doesn't prompt you to take breaks
	- If you rate the work as medium hard, it would prompt you for occasional breaks
	- If you rate the work as hard, it would prompt you to go talk with someone
	- Assumptions
		- You know how hard a problem will be in advance
		- Your work varies in difficulty
			- Jimmy feels that he has very little busy work and most of it is hard
			- Neil feels like most of his is in the busy work or medium category
	- Notes
		- This problem seems to be a great fit for #School style work
		- Could be a good #PlugIn for google or apple calendar

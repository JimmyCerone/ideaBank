#Problem: #Sports #Projections are garbage.

## Context
 - The projections for fantasy football were consistently off by greater than 50%. It was worse than #Random.

## Reflection
- We are limited in our ability to predict the feature, perhaps best argued by [[Black Swan by Nassim Taleb]]. BUT it seems like ESPN is especially bad. 
	- There is no accounting for #Risk in player projections. The way to win a fantasy game is to have a few players blow up. That is better than lots of mediocre players. Yet a players variability is compressed into their average points and their projection (which is often way off). 
	- Sports projects should shift towards #Risk / variability models that attempt to predict variability, not quantity. 

## Connections
- This reminds me of many peoples approach to #Budgeting. This idea is present here : [[Budgeting apps don't work for inconsistent incomes]] and elsewhere. 
	- I think budgets should be done the same way as these sports lineups, by #Risk. Basically you have #Insurance for high risk items (with funds if needed) and then don't worry about low variability costs like groceries. 
		- All goes back to [[03062021 - Levers]] - saving tiny amounts of money won't matter if you get seriously injured. You are still screwed. 
		- We should optimize for low risk, not low cost.

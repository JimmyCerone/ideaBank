#Problem: Waiting around in a [[Zoom]] meeting sucks

Solution: 

- Pong for zoom


Think [[Google]] Dinosaur for Zoom.

#BadTiming - COVID is ending and this doesn't seem to be as big of a problem as I thought it was. Probably was a Zoom etiquette problem that is solved by just showing up later at a meeting. Back at the start, you might have showed up earlier because it was unfamiliar and people are now comfortable with zoom.

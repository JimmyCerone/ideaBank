#Problem: Traditional file directories are useless for organization complicated topics

## Context
- This was the problem we faced when building out our #Database for ideas - how do we surface them intelligently? #Obsidian does this by creating connections and surfacing random notes. Not perfect, but better. 

## Connections 
- Subset of [[There is a high overhead for organizing information]]. 
- Similar to the [[Search engines cast too wide a net]] problem - kind of like a local subset. 
- Similar as well to the information mixing problems, like [[Solutions with potential to be generalized get stuck in silos]] and in some ways a subset to [[Humans have limited memories]]. If we could remember everything and have good recall, bad file structure wouldn't matter.

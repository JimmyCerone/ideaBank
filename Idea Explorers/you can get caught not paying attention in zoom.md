#Problem: you can get caught not paying attention in zoom

Fervant Desire: 

- I want to be able to do whatever the hell I want during meetings (like making food or other high engagement activities), without fearing my name will be called

Problem: Meetings require just enough attention to stop you from doing useful things. You can't fully focus on something else during a useless meeting. 

Solution: #Zoom extension that lets you know when your name is mentioned 

- The same tech as Siri or Amazon it's just that you get to pick the name.

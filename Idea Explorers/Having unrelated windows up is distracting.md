#Problem: Having unrelated windows up is distracting 

## Solution:

- single window
- caching windows that aren't being used
	- unused windows drop away, easy to recover but hidden from sight (with something like CMD+H)
- ask when you bring a new window in ([[Actuflow]])

## Connections
- Kind of like a cousin of [[Dumb phones are too dumb and smart phones are too smart]]. 
- Kind of solved in the extreme sense by [[Cold Turkey]]'s micromanager.
	- Supreme focus where the goal here is mostly to have a clean enough workspace. 

## Example
- Having a desk that is neat but maybe crowded instead of having papers everything or even having it spotless (which means you don't have everything you need)
	- The goal is to have _just_ what you need, not 1 thing att a time

#Problem: Search engines (like #Google) cast too wide a net

The Problem is two sided
1. Depth of search (how many results)
2. Breadth of search (how closely related)

- The visual above assumes you have infinite depth - you are returning every result you have (like Google)
- We could augment this image with depth and show what would happen if we intentionally limited the number of results

Solution: 
 - A simple search engine that only gives you 5 results
 - A search engine that tells lets you "tune" it. 
 - Lazy search of just wikipedia to restrict results and allow for interesting connections

Question: 
- How hard is it to build a search engine?
	- Based on preliminary research, very hard. 

## Connections
- [[Where Good Ideas Come From by Steven Johson]] said that search engines are too focused, which is a breadth problem. This problem we are looking at is a depth problem (too many of the same things).
	- He wanted both more breadth and less depth
- Idea came from [[Basecamp]] founder Jason Fried
- In the [[The Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz]], he proposes a #Filters of, "Are you going to be the best in that field?"
	- Could we beat google? Bing pays people to use it and can't topple Google. [[DuckDuckGo]] goes the privacy route. 
- The [[03062021 - Levers]] we have identified are:
	- The Database
		- We could use #Wikipedia, which would limit the depth of our search and give us fewer results
		- We could also use an online #Dictionary. 

## Sales Pitch
- "A search engine that makes you smarter"
- "A search engine that makes mistakes"
- "A search engine that brings you new things"
- "Our search engine is like clicking "I'm feeling lucky" every time"

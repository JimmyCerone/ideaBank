#Problem: Ideas in articles are hard to extract

## Connections
- This is deeply connected to [[Uneven Distribution]]. The quality and quantity of ideas are not evenly distributed throughout an article. 
- [[The Art of Gathering by Priya Parker]] would lend itself well to having short summaries.
	- [[Switch - How to Change Things When Change is Hard by Dan and Chip Heath]] and [[The Righteous Mind by Jonathon Haidt]] and [[Head First SQL]] all do this super. 

## Solution: 

- Setup your website to do a quick version and a long version option to allow for different extraction abilities..
- Within books and articles have quizzes throughout the material like [[Orbit]] and [[Quantum Country by Andu Mutaschak and Michael Nielson]]
- Could we teach this framework? 
	- If writers are the problem, can we change the supply side? 
- Could we do a website that breaks down content for people like [[Blinkist]]?
	- Could I build this into my website? [[Personal Website and writing]]


I think this is just a problem with authors writing. I find that when I ([[Neil]]) read a book, I just wish that they would give me an outline/ checklist/ summary. Basically, I agree that this is a problem, but I would question what is at the root of this problem. 

## Question
- Is this is a writer or a reader problem?
	- Mostly a writing format problem. Much of writing is not digestible enough.

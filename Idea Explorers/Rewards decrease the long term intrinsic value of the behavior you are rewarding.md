Source: Fable from [[Punished by Rewards by Alfie Kohn]]

### Fable
- Old man gets heckled by school children every day. To stop this, he pays them to make fun of him. He starts with $1 then gradually decreases the payment until it's nothing. When he tells them he won't pay them anymore, they say, "Why would we make fun of you for free?"

#Problem: Rewards decrease the long term intrinsic value of the behavior you are rewarding.

## Solution: 

- Reward bad behavior to reduce long term interest

## Counter Evidence
- How do we reconcile this with [[The Power of Habits by Charles Duhigg]] and the [[202105071241 - Habit Loop]] in there? 
	- Is it that long term rewards do this? Can rewards be used in the short term? 
- What about my own habit formation that has worked really well - [[Reward Myself for Meditating Daily & Monthly]]? 
- [[202105071242 - The key to a successful habit is that it creates a craving.]] does that make sense here? 

## Connections
- Reminds me of [[Liv Panozzo]] who talks about not bribing #Blue. I can't show him a treat before asking him to do something, I have to give him the treat after he does something. So he has to intrinsically do it, then I can reward that instead of prompting the behavior with a reward. 


## Question
- Does this work for removing habits only? 
	- How does it connect to [[202103171230 - Quitting multiple habits at once is easier than quitting one at a time]]?
- Can this work on systemic level for things like [[Dopesick by Beth Macy]]? 
- Is the gradation the problem? Do binary goals work better? 

## #Risk
- How do you keep sadists out of this??
	- This risk makes it #Hard 
		- That said, we could do this as a #Lab or #Studio

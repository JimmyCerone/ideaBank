#Problem: Our email is the key to all of our accounts

## Solution
- Memorize a unique username and password for everything
	- Doesn't work because [[Humans have limited memories]]. 
- [[Bitwarden]] does a good job here but the system still relies on email.
- Biometrics seem to work here, though deep fakes are an area of concern, especially given improvements in [[VR & AR]]. 
- Change from secret to uniquely you.
	- Basically what [[Blockchain]] is trying to do, though it could all be ruined by [[Quantum Computing]].

## Connections
- Kind of similar to [[03-04-2021 - Unbundling your phone into separate functions]] as both are based on [[202105081850 - Bundling is efficient but high risk]]. 
- A problem in part because [[202105172120 - Networked systems are vulnerable]] & [[202105172121 - The internet was made assuming all actors are trustworthy]]. So basically email is like inherently insecure yet it is the key to all our accounts. 
	- [[Risk is not taken into account in our financial system]] - kind of an extension of this.

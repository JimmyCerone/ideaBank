## Current Solution
- His brother in law can size this up by eye and is super accurate. 
- Counter to click off the number of logs of each length.
	- Rescaling and measuring every log diameter.


## Solution: 

- Can you use AR? Computer Vision?

Volume calculation is very sensitive to diameter because it is squared. 

## Benefits
- Helps estimate how much revenue you can make
- Helps you accurately understand how much you need to move it / process it

## TODOS
- [x] Ask Tad about this
- [ ] Look up existing product that figures out the board feet in a bundle of processed wood via image. 
- [ ] Company that is already rolling up technologies - #Acquire #LowHangingFruit

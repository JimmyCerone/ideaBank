#Problem: We think in 3D but we code in 2D

- We use spatial orientation to lower [[03092021 - Working Memory]] so by using 2D screens we make coding harder because we have to keep more in our heads. More on this in [[3D Operating Systems]]. 

## Solution
- Coding blocks like [[Timeular]] for simple code to teach kids
- Turn Object Oriented stuff into unique objects with [[AI]] so that you have some reference point. 
	- You could even make them fit together like a puzzle
- Turn this into a map and make a mind palace

#Problem: There is not always a place you can drop off things for a friend to pick up

## Solution
- There used to be higher levels of trust in #Community where certain people where nodes you could trust (kind of like what is attempting to be replicated with [[Blockchain]]). So I could drop off my key with Sal and he would give it to you for me. 
	- With the breakdown of community ([[Bowling Alone]]) this no longer works, in part because of the stupid "Sharing economy"
- Revitalize community ([[Switch - How to Change Things When Change is Hard by Dan and Chip Heath]] & [[The Village Effect]])
	- OR
- Digitally accessible lock box
	- Like [[Amazon]] lockers except not for selling things.
		- This is a good proof of concept.

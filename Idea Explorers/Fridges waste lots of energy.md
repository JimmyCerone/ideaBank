#Problem: Fridges waste lots of #Energy 

Solution: 
- make a low mass transfer fridge about $200 a year..couldn't find a break down of energy loss in a fridge.
- A vending machine style fridge
	- This could help with dieting (so you could hide bad food behind opaque glass)
	- You could create custom rules and #Automation to help with meal prep
		- Surface items that are about to expire
		- Intelligently dispense snacks and water
			- Refill water bottles and have them ready for when you leave
	- Could save energy? 
	- You could have to "pay" more for certain foods.

#Problem: #Hiring is expensive with high risk of sunk cost fallacy

## Solutions

- What if hiring were done in a coalition of companies so that when you said no to one person you could refer them to someone else or you could even have people rotate between the companies to see which they would fit best at?
- This helps resolve the problem of someone not being quite the right fit for you but feeling really guilty about letting them go. It also allows you to take people for a test drive without unfairly taking advantage of them.

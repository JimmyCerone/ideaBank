## Investment Heuristics
1. Invest equal amount of money in every IPO
2. Invest equal shares in every IPO
3. Invest equal amount of money in 1 IPO per week
4. Invest equal amount of shares in 1 IPO per week
5. Wait until there's an IPO of your choice and invest equal number of shares, cost, or lump sum (save up set amount every week then invest what you have)
6. Invest an equal amount of money per day (stack days together if there were no IPOs)

### 4 Main Segments
1. Every IPO
	- Equal shares
	- Equal money
2. ~~Your choice~~
	- Won't be systematic and thus won't do much good to simulate. Our ability to choose will have huge impacts and we aren't trying to start our own mutual fund. 
3. Every week (Randomly selected IPO)
	- Equal shares
	- Equal Money
4. Every day (Randomly selected IPO with cascades)
	- Equal shares
	- Equal money

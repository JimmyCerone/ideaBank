#Problem: Roofs absorb heat at the wrong times

- In the summer they are dark and absorb heat and in the winter they are snow covered which means they reflect heat. Ideally, it would be the opposite.

## Solution
- Color changing roof
- White roof
	- It's already white in winter (that's a variable you can't control) but it being white in summer would be quite useful
- Plant deciduous trees 
	- They do this naturally. Shade in summer and let sun in during the fall
	- Bright spot - [[Switch - How to Change Things When Change is Hard by Dan and Chip Heath]]

## Connections
- [[Tesla]] is working on solar roofs which kind of help with this
	- What environmental effects could this have? [[Scientists unearth a consequence of solar panels in the Sahara]].

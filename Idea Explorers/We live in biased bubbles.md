#Problem: We live in biased bubbles & simply being exposed to the "other side" doesn't make us less biased ([[The Righteous Mind by Jonathon Haidt]])

## Solution
- Create a feed where you have identify "fake" stories among real ones
	- #Game it. 
	- Use [[AI]] #API to generate fake stories and use a web scraper to grab real ones. 
	- Do it from your side of the aisle and the other said to show you are biased both ways

## Risks of Solution
- Generating meaningful story comparisons
	- How hard is this? Is AI good enough to do this? 
	- How do we prevent our own bias from having an impact?

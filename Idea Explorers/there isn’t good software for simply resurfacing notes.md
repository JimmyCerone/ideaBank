#Problem: there isnâ€™t good software for simply resurfacing notes

Trello / google keep + resurfacing & tagging. This would solve our archive problem. 

Obsidian does this but you have manually kick off the command. 

Solution: 
- Use the obsidian api to automate the sending of a note. 
- A really interesting solution would connect all your note sources (like Zapier) and send random notes from them all

#Solved: Remnote / Neurocache

#Problem: Insects are annoying at bonfires

## Solution 
- Burnable insect repellent
- Essential oils
- Wood? Is there wood that does this?
	- Are there natural additives?

## Question
- Why hasn't someone already done this?
- Can you adapt existing solutions?

## Risk
- Could this be bad for the environment? Dogs? Humans?
- Can you make this smell good?
- Would the fact it burns limit the number of solutions?
	- It's basically second order consequences from [[Principles by Ray Dalio]] which makes it especially to test.

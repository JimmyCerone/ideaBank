#Problem: We realized that there are platforms for products (i.e. Product Hunt), questions (i.e. Quora), and fundraising (i.e. AngelList), but there isn't a platform for people to share and validate startup ideas to see if theyâ€™re worth building.

## Solution: 

- We built a consolidated space for entrepreneurial creatives to find, share, and grow startup ideas.

Solution: kern.al

Neil: I think people like talking about their startup but not listening to others. could be wrong tho

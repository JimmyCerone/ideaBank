#Problem: You can't cancel or manage #Donations in a centralized location

## Context
- When I tried to transfer my #Giving, I had to do it manually and often got double charged for my trouble.
	- The standard practice was to create a new charge then they'd cancel the old one. That means you get double charged. You basically either get charged twice or zero times.

## Questions
- Why aren't there just accounts? 
- Why hasn't someone done like a Paypal solution?
	- The #OregonExtension did this and it was super easy to cancel. Why don't more people do this?
- Why do the #Companies hold all the cards? 
- Why isn't there more awareness about this?
- How many people give consistently?
	- This problem only occurs when you have recurring payments, and when you change who you are giving too or who you are banking from.
- What if it's the same idea as #Internet companies?
	- Make it super hard to cancel your #Subscription on purpose. 

## Reflections
- Based on [[Bowling Alone]] - the trend for organizations has been from intensive organizations that require you to hold positions and attend meetings. This has slowly transitioned to requiring less and less effort. It might be that creating an account and having a membership is too high of a bar for most people.

#Problem: There is no general advice #Book for #Technical #Careers

There is no [[The Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz]] for #Engineers. All the books for engineers are super technical. 

## Context
- There are some books for #Product Managers, like [[Inspired by Marty Cagan]], which are what some engineers turn into. That's kind of related. 
- [[Neil]] came up with this and poked around on [[2021-03-10]] and couldn't find any promising #Books.

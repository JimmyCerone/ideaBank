#Problem: Starting new books is the pits and choosing new books is even worse

      

## Solution: 

  

\- Sample random first chapters from audiobooks, see if you get hooked

  

## Question: 

  

\- How could we pilot this? Are there freely available audio books? 

\- Could we use an overdrive API for this?

  

## Experiment: 

  

\- Can we rent a bunch of audio books and try this ourselves?

\- Can we try this just by downloading a bunch of overdrive books and switch every X minutes with a timer?

  

## Implementation Hypothesis: 

  

\- We could prioritize non weight listed books and increase utilization of library resources (which is probably our value add here)

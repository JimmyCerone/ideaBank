#Problem: The more purchases you make, the more money you spend. 

This idea comes from levers, where there a few levers to reduce your spending: 

- Spend less frequently
- spend more efficiently

Solution: Limit spending by limiting the number of purchases.

Question: Would number of purchases be a good heuristic for budgeting?

We chatted about this together and then saw this by Pete the Planner: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/nmneilweeda%40gmail.com/FMfcgxwKjwzcDvnhjvcKkjPssGQSLcxG

This is also an example of a lever. One way to spend less, is to spend less often.

#Problem: There is no centralized way to compare wifi prices

- Probably because these #Monopoly control the #Internet 
- Part of the problem is that [[Wifi speed is meaningless]] so it's hard to compare value.

## Solution
- Website like [[The Zebra]] but for Wifi.
- #Spreadsheets to figure out all the costs similar to [[Housing cost calculators don't include long term costs like roof repair]] & [[Landlords are often predatory]]


## Questions
- Has this been attempted? 
- Would a big internet company kill this?

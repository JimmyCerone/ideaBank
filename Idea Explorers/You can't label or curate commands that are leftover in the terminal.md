#Problem: You can't label or curate commands that are leftover in the #Terminal 

## Solution

- It'd be awesome to label and group commands (other than using an alias) as part of a particular process or "broken". I keep using broken commands because I can't remember which is which. 
	- Project
	- Tech Stack
	- Broken / Working

## Questions
- How hard is it to get access to command history and command quantity? 
	- Would it be best to display this within the terminal or outside of it?

## Connections
- This could solve this as well by giving you the ability to add context to a command: [[Even if you resolve an error on the terminal on the terminal, it's easy to forget how]]

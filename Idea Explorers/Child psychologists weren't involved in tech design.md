#Problem: Child psychologists weren't involved in #Tech #Design 

#App s were created for #Profit first, which leads to bad #Developmental outcomes for #Kids. 

The problem is that these bad outcomes are quite attractive to kids, which ties to [[03102021 - Not all tech is helpful]]. So the question is, how do you make tech better suited for kids? Do you just not make tech for kids? 

## Questions
- Can #Psychology help you make tech better for kids?
- Where is the line between well being and #Capitalism? [[03102021 - Some inventions are better left uninvented]]... 
- Is tech even the answer here?
- What is the role of #Government in regulating this? Have they failed to?

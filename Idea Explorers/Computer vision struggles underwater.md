#Problem: #Computer #Vision struggles underwater

- There are lots of reasons for this, lots of [[03062021 - Levers]] that make it hard for computers to see underwater:
	- Movement - the #Camera is always moving. 
	- Light differences - water diffracts light weirdly
	- Data - we don't have much data on underwater structures
	- Power source - you don't often have unlimited power
	- Marine corrosion - cameras have to be specially made
	- Many Hardware Types - which do you pick? This splits development efforts

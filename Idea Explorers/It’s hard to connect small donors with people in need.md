#Problem: itâ€™s hard to connect small #Donors with people in need 

## Context
- Uncle Dan and man with bike (he used his to get to #Work and it broke, leaving him without transportation). Dan gave him his bike, which cost like $300. A small amount of #Money that made a big difference. 
-  Uncle Dan couldn't reach his friend in Morocco via Paypal or anything like that to help fund his wheelchair, which similarly cost a small amount. 


This is complicated because #Giving to big organizations is the more #Efficiency oriented way to do this. Yet, targeted #Giving can have a huge impact on quality of life. 

## Solutions
- #Microlending is a way to solve the small giving problem, but doesn't solve the specificity problem.

## Levers

There are a couple of #Levers here:
- Small Scale
	- #Microlending solves this problem, but doesn't improve targeting. You can't micro lend to specific people as an individual.
	- World Renew is a CRC arm that deals with global help and you can buy 1 chicken for a family (things like that)
		- Save the Children does a similar thing
- Specificity
	- Presents a problem in and of itself. Are individuals qualified to determine where the #Money is most needed? Are big organizations better at this or worse? 
		- Tom's Shoes is an example of a big corporation that did a terrible job of this. They ravaged the #Economics of regions because of their size. 
	- On the other hand, specificity prevents (to some extent) scale problems. It limits #Risk of any one gift. 
	- Brings in the problem brought up by Singer in [[People from wealthy nations don't give away enough money]] - how do you discern who to give money to? What's a worthy cause? By giving generally, you offload this question.

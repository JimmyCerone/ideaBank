#Problem: Item finders require smartphones

## Background

There is no way to setup a Tile (or alternative) without a smart phone. 

  

This is bad for seniors and other people who opt out of the smart phone market. 
- People who take [[Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport]] seriously could struggle with this
	- [[Lightphone]]. 

## Trends
- Will the number of people without smart phones increase or decrease?
	- Will there be some equillibrium reached where some subset of people consistently opt out? 
		- Will companies like [[Apple]] support this?
			- How will [[Facebook]] react if this is the case?
				- What if they gave out free phones?
	- Will the people who opt out of smart phones also opt out of other technologies?
		- Will they move to a farm in Oregon?

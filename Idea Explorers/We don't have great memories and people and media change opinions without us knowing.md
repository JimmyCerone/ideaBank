#Problem: We don't have great #Memory and people and media change #Opinions without us knowing

## Solution
- Web scraper that keeps track of different sites stands on different issues and how they've evolved over time

## Questions
- Does this matter? 
	- What does knowing that people have changed their opinions do for us? How does that improve our lives?
- Do people care that others change their opinions? 
	- Trump and McConnell and many, many others have publicly changed opinions on a topic with little to no consequences
	- Lindsey Graham voted against Merrick Garland and said, "Read my lips - in 4 years I will not vote to appoint". 4 years later, he did vote on Amy Barret Cohen with no consequences. 
- Is this problem already solved?
	- Does the internet and #Twitter do a good job of fact checking this?
- Shouldn't people change their minds in light of new #Facts?
	- Would this hinder people's ability to change their minds?

## Context
- Came up with this while reading [[King Leopold's Ghost]] and learning about how he manipulated the media. 
	- He paid off critical #Newspapers to start writing #FakeNews positive articles about the Congo to cover up the genocide. 


## Connections
- Reminds me of [[The Righteous Mind by Jonathon Haidt]], which makes the point that facts don't really matter. [[Why We're Polarized by Ezra Klein]] also makes the same point, showing that it's not necessarily the facts that people are looking for. Our support of people is more #Emotional than #Logical.

#Problem: Hard to know if shoes are worn out

- Worn out shoes lead to injuries, which suck. Plus they make you look bad.

## Solution
- [[VR & AR]] that checks out a shoe
	- Could start out as #WizardOfOz 
- Make the shoe fail in some obvious way
	- It could even have failure stages so people can prepare

## Risk
- How much data is required? 
- How much variation is there in shoes?
- Are other companies already doing this? Would they want this or not?

## Assumption
- It is hard to say when shoes are worn out. 
	- Is it hard to know when they are worn out? Is the visual look of a shoe a good indicator?

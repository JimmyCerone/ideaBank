#Problem: You can't draw on your screen unless you are sharing it

## Solution: 

- This used to work but doesn't any longer: https://flyingmeat.com/flysketch/
- Epic Pen
- [[Remarkable]] is a solution to this and so is [[Boox]] but not on the laptop. 
	- Kind of like a smart board
- Use keyboard shortcuts to enter, exit, and erase

## Connections
- Asked [[Tuple]] if they could pull out the pen feature and they said they couldn't because it was deeply embedded in their app

## Question
- What if you had a Tuple like marker available all the time? - Available via a shortcut
	- [[Zoom]] technically does this but does it badly. 
- Why isn't this a thing? Is it hard to make layers on a computer? 
- Why didn't smart boards take off? What made them die out? 
- Is it because that people assume that if you are looking at things, you can just use your finger? 
	- Is this better than doing things with your finger? Is it more specific and helpful?

#Problem: Masks are hard to breathe in

## Solutions 
- gag solutions 
	- holes 
	- valves 
	- not having nose in 
	- neck gators
- [[03062021 - Levers]]
	- Rigidity of the mask
	- Distance between mask and face
	- Education- how do you use a mask and get used to it 
	- air exchange 


## Connections
- Probably more of people in the end than a tech problem. CDC could have used [[Switch - How to Change Things When Change is Hard by Dan and Chip Heath]] and [[The Power of Habits by Charles Duhigg]] when crafting guidelines.

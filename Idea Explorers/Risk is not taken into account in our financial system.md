#Problem: #Risk is not taken into account in our #Finance system

There are a few levels to this problem: 

** Personal ** 
- Our budgets have no indication of risk. So you could have a super tight budget that is super vulnerable to a disruption of income with no idea of the risk. 
** Worldwide ** 
- Many of our #Companies  have no real way to account for risk, financial or otherwise (see [[What We Can learn from a Big Boat Stuck in a Canal]]). 

My hunch is that this is a #Visualizaton  problem. [[Atomic Object]] seems to have good tools for mitigating risk so it might be a process thing as well.

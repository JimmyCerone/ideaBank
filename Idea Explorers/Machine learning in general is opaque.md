#Problem: [[042220212143 - Machine Learning]] in general is opaque. 

[[03062021 - Levers]]:
- Reveal opacity
- Decrease opacity

Solution: 
- Sleek interface on top of a machine learning algorithm that let you interact with it to see how it worked. The goal here is to help people recognize that [[202103211307 - Machine learning faces the same limits as human learning - environment is everything]] & therefore [[202104222236 - Machine learning is biased.]]
	- # of inputs
	- # of nodes
	- # of layers of nodes
	- Type of data
		- Raw #'s would allow you to pick what the computer focuses on while unsupervised learning wouldn't. 
- Facial recognition that mistakes you for other people.
- Show the dangers of this by creating a game that shows you how your credit worthiness and other stuff is determined by machine learning we don't understand.
	- Make it rigged behind the scenes and reveal that at the end of the game. So some people get a super easy game and others get a super hard game and it's completely random as to why. 
	- Reminds me a little bit of a [[MSCHF]] project. 


## Problem
- This could result in a broader scope than is desired. People could generalize the results to all computer programming unless care is taken.

#Problem: You can't see #Code evolve over time

## Context: 
- Code is built up in layers and just like #Geology, it's super helpful to see how those layers developed over time

## Solution: 

- Use #Git logs to slowly "rebuild" code so you can see how it evolved over time
- #VSCode #PlugIn

## Examples: 

- Wayback Machine for #Website 
- #History for #Google Docs

#Problem: There is information asymmetry between Big Tech and common people

## Questions
- Can you use the system against them? 
	- Could you change specific variables and see what happened?
		- What will removing [[Twitter]] as part of my [[Atomic/My Spin/Digital Minimalism]] experiment do to the algorithm?
- How do browsers and search engines influence this?


## Solution: 
- What if you had Cypress visit certain sites every day to control [[Google]] image of and what ads you are served?
	- Could you confuse them? What would that do?
- Can you make a map of the things you are exposed to online and back out what the algorithm thinks of you then experiment? 
	- Create a #ChromeExtension that captures the ads you are served and shows them to you. 
		- [[AI]] that collects commonalities in the ads and tells you about yourself
			- Is there a tag in HTML that distinguishes an ad?
			- Could you manually mark ads? 

- Further, can you get people to sign on together to figure out the whole of their network by sharing data in something like a DAO?

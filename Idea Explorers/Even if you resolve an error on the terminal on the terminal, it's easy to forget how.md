#Problem: Even if you resolve an error on the #Terminal on the terminal, it's easy to forget how

Solution:

- History of errors followed by the commands run after them
- The option to save a sequence of commands as a "bundle"
	- Aliases kind of do this
	- What if was like a `git bisect`? 


In a way, this is an #Idea flow problem within yourself. Like a smaller version of [[Solutions with potential to be generalized get stuck in silos]], which itself is a partial subset of [[Humans have limited memories]].

#Problem: When thru #Hiking, it is best to use a tarp tent (because of weight) but free standing tents are easier/better.

## Solution: 
- Can you make an inflatable tent? Would this save weight? How long would it take to inflate it? Would this provide insulation? Would this be a bomb winter tent? 

## Questions
- Would you have to have an airtight seal?
	- yes. Seems like the biggest risk.
- How would this perform in wind?

## Assumptions
- You could end up with more material than otherwise, unless you ended up moving away from the X structure. 
	- Air is a good insulator - making it a good winter tent
	- What shape could it be if inflated by air?
- How hard is it to prototype fabric goods?
	- What could it be if not fabric?
- What if it was porous like Styrofoam? Like inflatable styrofoam?

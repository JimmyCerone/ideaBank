#Problem: There are no places to #Wait while in a #Car

- Jimmy gets into the situation where he can't be at Liv's house while she's not there. So therefore he's stuck in his car. There are no good places to #Park and sit without feeling suspicious. There are no good car based waiting areas. 


## Question
- Why do we find people sitting in there cars suspicious? 
- Would people pay for this? 
- Do people actually find people sitting in cars suspicious? Why is it so awkward if not?


## Reflection
- This is like the larger problem of waiting for things and the awkwardness that entails. Phones kind of solve that problem.

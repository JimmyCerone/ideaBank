#Problem: It's hard to connect with people on large video calls

## Solution
- Random pairings in [[Zoom]] meetings
- Mini speakers that you can array around your room to get surround sound and simulate multiple channels
- [[Teamflow]] replicates the office.
- [[03062021 - Levers]]
	- Spontaneity 
	- Framing Issue
		- [[Switch - How to Change Things When Change is Hard by Dan and Chip Heath]] shaping the path problem in that we call all video calls "meetings" which aren't built for connecting
	- Limited sensory inputs
		- Visual and sound with no tactile
	- Single channel
		- All input and output goes through the same channel whereas in real life you have 3D channels
		- Peanut gallery can't exist because it gets put right at the center. 
		- Raises the bar for what content gets shared and shrinks the amount of information communicated. 
		- X to X
			- Most Zoom calls are 1 to many instead of many to many or many to one
			- In real life there are lots of nodes and connections happening in a conversation (like an [[Obsidian]] thing). Zoom meetings are more like books while normal meetings are like conversations

## Counterpoint
- Video meetings allow you to communicate via private channels like [[Slack]] which is a major plus because you can process in real time.

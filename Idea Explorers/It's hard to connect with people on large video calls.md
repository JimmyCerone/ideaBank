#Problem: It's hard to connect with people on large video calls

## Solution
- Random pairings in [[Zoom]] meetings
- Mini speakers that you can array around your room to get surround sound and simulate multiple channels
- [[Teamflow]] replicates the office.
- [[03062021 - Levers]]
	- Modes of communication
		- Body Language
			- Phone booth that tries to mimic a meeting as much as possible
				- Mimic the aspect ratio of a real person exactly. Basically makes the video feed seem like a window. 
		- Facial Expressions
		- Tone
		- What else?
			- Smell, etc
	- Spontaneity 
	- Latency
		- How does latency affect the ability to communicate?
			- What is the latency of an in person conversation? How much does the latency of video throw us off?
	- Framing Issue
		- [[Switch - How to Change Things When Change is Hard by Dan and Chip Heath]] shaping the path problem in that we call all video calls "meetings" which aren't built for connecting
	- Limited sensory inputs
		- Visual and sound with no tactile
	- Single channel
		- All input and output goes through the same channel whereas in real life you have 3D channels
			- This makes it impossible to interrupt gracefully and it's the reason that there are more size constraints than in person meetings. So you can have an efficient with 100 people in person but that isn't the case remote - [[Russell]].
		- Peanut gallery can't exist because it gets put right at the center. 
		- Raises the bar for what content gets shared and shrinks the amount of information communicated. 
		- X to X
			- Most Zoom calls are 1 to many instead of many to many or many to one
			- In real life there are lots of nodes and connections happening in a conversation (like an [[Obsidian]] thing). Zoom meetings are more like books (linear and sequential) while normal meetings are like conversations

	- Personality
		- [[Quiet by Susan Cain]] talks about the benefits of distance for introverts
			- Soft spoken people can use the main channel just as well as the extroverted person
## Questions
- Could you add channels by putting different people's voices through your headphones?
	- Would it make sense to do this at a small scale? Would it be useful if you could only use it for 3 people at a time?
		- Some of this is done on [[VR & AR]] & [[Teamflow]]
			- These incorporate the direction of your head as well. Does [[Microsoft]] teams have this?
		- Is [[Apple]] doing some of this [[The New 3D Apple Arriving at WWDC]]?
			- The above approaches give us more channels. 
				- Can we replicate every channel of in person? What's the relative value of each channel? 
					- 100% replication of audio and video could bring us to 90% of in person is our hypothesis
						- How would we replicate interactions with other objects? 
							- If we can do [[VR & AR]] then we can do 3D objects. 

## Counterpoint
- Video meetings allow you to communicate via private channels like [[Slack]] which is a major plus because you can process in real time.
	- The cost of creating additional channels in real life is low near you but high far away from you ([[202105051639 - We have solved most of our problems, just not in a consistent and distributed way]])

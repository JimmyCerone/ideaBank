#Problem: BBQ sauce is so #Wasteful because it clings to the bottle

Solution:
- #Kickstarter [[Neil]] #PhysicalProduct that solves this problem in some magical way
- Plunger or squeeze tube
- Could be a stand alone product or an add on
- Bottle with a big enough mouth to allow for a rubber scraper
- Alternatively, a rubber scraper that is designed to fit into any size of bottle.

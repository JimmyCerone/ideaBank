#Problem:  In college business competitions, the quality of the invention is rarely assessed, just the prospects of the business.

## Background
- Ran into this with [[Deep Sight]] where [[Locker Lifestyle]] was a great business and beat us out because they already had revenue. The measurement wasn't what could be innovative, but what was already working well. 


## Alignment
- Hits the theme of #Community, #Ideas, and #Brainstorming 
- Would give us a bit of a platform and act as like a publicity stunt.


## Solution
- Have an invention competition instead of a business competition. 

## Precedent
- I think that they had something like this at the Centennial world fair. 

## Questions
- Could we pilot this without a prize? 
- Could we make a non-monetary prize?
	- Brainstorm with us
	- Engineering services
	- Access to our vault to pull out any idea they want

#Problem: Pestering #Companies  works but is time consuming

## Solution
- This isn't complicated, so we can automate it
	- Automatic [[Twitter]] bot that @'s companies that have done you wrong
	- Email sender that sends lots of emails
	- Automatic caller that calls
- Like [[Truebill]] for company complaints or [[Democracy.io]] for contacting politicians.


## Risk
- Do we represent the person or impersonate them?
	- If we impersonate how do we ensure #Privacy  and make sure nothing goes awry?
	- How do we balance privacy and adequate information?
	- Can we advocate on the behalf of someone else?
- Getting marked as spam / getting banned
	- How do we avoid facing legal consequences ourselves?


#WizardOfOz - we can do all this behind the scenes in the early days.

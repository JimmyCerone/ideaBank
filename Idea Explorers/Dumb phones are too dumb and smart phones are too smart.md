#Problem: Dumb #Phone are too dumb and smart phones are too smart

Solution: 

- Make your own version of #Android that has one version for #Camera, #Calling, and texting. Then there is an annoying #Password to type in to get into the "smart" part of the phone

- Have 2 phones in one, a smart and dumb one controlled by #Software 

#Levers - the goal is to slow things down and make sure you are intentional with your use of the phone. The goal is to get yourself into #System2 from [[Thinking Fast and Slow]]. Phones right now keep us stuck in #System1, like the elephant from [[The Righteous Mind by Jonathon Haidt]]. By slowing things down, we hope that we can make phones more intentional.

#Problem: Socks are not foot specific

## Solution
- #Solved  at least partially (finding the bright spot - [[Switch - How to Change Things When Change is Hard by Dan and Chip Heath]]) by:
	- [[Nike]] right and left feet
	- Toe socks have right and left feet
- [[VR & AR]] to model. your foot and make a sock specific for it
	- What benefits would this have? 
		- Longer lasting?
		- Better performance?
		- Less stink?
		- Help people with disabilities?
	- How hard would this be to do?
	- Can these be 3D printed? Automated?

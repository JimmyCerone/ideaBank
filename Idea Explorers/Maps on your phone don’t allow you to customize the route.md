#Problem: Maps on your phone don’t allow you to customize the route 


Solution:

- specify things like no 2 lane roads or only highways
- “teach it” routes that you like to follow later
	- Have it watch passively and learn what you like
	- Have it actively ask you questions like, "Was this a pretty drive?"
	- What if it actively helped you explore (opt-in)?
- set default routes

## Questions
- What if this isn't an app but a special kind of GPS device like Garmin? 
	- Would it be easier to do it as an app or device?
- How much is this a thing of the past? 
	- In the past people used GPS or maps and kind of found their own routes (sneaky back ways). How much do people still do this in the age of smartphones? 
- Do people care about anything other than time? 
	- Would people make the tradeoff of 1 minute longer but twice as pretty? 
- Would this increase or decrease people's understanding of the land?
- [[Making decisions is hard]] - how could the number of decisions be kept manageable?

#Problem: #SocialMedia hijacks our attention

## Solution: 

- Chrome extension that creates a timer for social media sites (like cold turkey for social media)
	- [[Cold Turkey]] allows you to set a timer for the whole day or for like a time block but it's hard to quickly set an intention and timer like in [[Actuflow]] for the phone. 

(Automatic monitoring)

Cold Turkey is binary, it either lets you or it doesn't and you have to either manually lock yourself our or automatically schedule it. 

This would let you be on at any time, but would limit the amount of time you have on there in any one session. 

A more challenging solution is to get blocked by Twitter for inciting an insurrection.

#Lacking - needs some levers thrown in. Also seems to be well #Solved and #Hard which makes me want to stay away.

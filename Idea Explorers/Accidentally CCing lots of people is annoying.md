## #Problem: Accidentally CCing lots of people is annoying

- CC ends up allowing lots of long annoying reply chains ([[Accidentally replying all is disruptive to lots of people (so is purposefully doing so)]]) that disturb lots of people. It also hurts #Privacy.

## Solution
- have an #ChromeExtension that asks you if you would like to BCC if there are more than a certain number of people in the CC box
	- If only Hope College had this... Me and many others would have been saved from embarrassing email chains.

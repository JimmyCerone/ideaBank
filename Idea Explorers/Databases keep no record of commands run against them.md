#Problem: Databases keep no record of commands run against them

- Subset of the problem [[Humans have limited memories]] at the intersection of tech and humanity ([[202104300025 - Exosomatic memory systems mean we are already bionic]]). What is happening here is that the commands we run against a database should probably be kept in memory because we expect them to be. What happens is that we forget what we've run and we waste time running it again. 

Solution: 
- Iterm #PlugIn that saves commands you've run against the database (or just saves all commands and is easy to interface with)


Connected Idea:
- Broadly under the category of remembering commands on a terminal is [[Even if you resolve an error on the terminal on the terminal, it's easy to forget how]]. Somehow we have to improve the terminal.

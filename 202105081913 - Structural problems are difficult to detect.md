## Idea
- Part of the reason for this is that [[202105081805 - People in power tell good stories about their system]] and part of it is that [[202105061553 - In abnormal circumstances, question base level assumptions]]. That's not our natural tendency, to question base level assumptions as it's hard and we don't like hard things ([[The Righteous Mind by Jonathon Haidt]]). 

## Example
> The ability for kids to pay for drugs with their parents money meant it would concealed longer because they weren't going around stealing shit as in other places that were hit by the heroin epidemic

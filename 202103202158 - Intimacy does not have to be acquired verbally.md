## Context
- Came across this idea in [[Mating in Captivity by Esther Perelle]], which is blowing my mind. There were so many ways in which I'd conceived #Intimacy and #Attraction incorrectly. 

## Idea
> No longer is it (intimacy) the deep knowledge and familiarity that develop over time and can be cultivated in silence. Instead we think of intimacy as a discursive process, one that involves self-disclosure, the trustful sharing of our most personal and private material - our feelings.


## Reflection
- I think I've largely missed this in my relationship with [[Liv Panozzo]]. I fall back on words because they are easy to understand and analyze. I get frustrated when we don't talk and I feel distant, even when she knows what is going on in my life just by watching me. I want to open up to the idea that maybe words don't have all the answers.

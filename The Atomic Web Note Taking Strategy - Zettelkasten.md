A note taking strategy created by a German sociologist who publish 70 books and 800+ research articles. 

Visually, the system looked like this - he did it all with note cards!!!

The true power of this system is that the notes are tagged and linked. Most note taking systems look like this:

The real power of this system is how #Atomic it is, that every note is unique, can stand alone, and is yet connected to all the rest. 

## Principles
1. Atomicity
2. Autonomy
	- Each note should stand alone
2. Link 
	- The process looks down on unlinked notes as a lost note... I've found that an unlinked note is probably a task for Bear
3. Explain why you are linking notes - just as when citing sources in a paper
4. No copy and paste (this will be hard)
5. No structure (I've got to undo a lot on this. Going to be hard. Probably going to have lots of ideas that then come together in one note - like a movie with lots of ideas is unified by a note with the movie)
6. Create connection notes that explain the connections between multiple other notes

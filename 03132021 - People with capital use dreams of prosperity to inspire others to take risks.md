## Context
 - [[King Leopold's Ghost]] the colonies used the same #Rhetoric as the #American dream to inspire people to move the #Africa and explore / fight. 


## Idea
- This can be seen in the #VC world as well. People with tons of money are rarely the ones taking the #Risk. They may provide the capital, but it's not much in comparison to their net worth. The people taking the real risks are the ones starting the #Companies and running the #Startups. Very similar to the #Lottery. 

## Connections
- This idea is a correlary of [[03062021 - The higher the initial investment, the higher the risk (and potential reward - sometimes)]]. People with lots of capital can afford to make many small, uncorrelated bets, as noted in [[Principles by Ray Dalio]], without risking much of their #Capital. Those who are invested in are often capital strapped in comparison and risk much more.

## Context
- Came across this idea in #LovesExecutioner in the chapter 3 unopened letters. In the chapter, a #Scientist who had a fellowship in Stockholm failed to publish work while there on a $50,000 stipend.

## Ideas
- The scientist assumed that his collaborator thought him incompetent and figured that telling him their work wasn't published would only confirm his suspicions. Further, this failure to publish was his first ever. Afraid to tell his collaborator of his failure, he hid it. His guilt and fear mounted when he received a letter from the institute, then another and another. The scientist, in his dazed state, figured these letters were to condemn him. Hoping to pacify the institute, he planned to return his $50,000 stipend. The scientist then froze. Unsure of what was in the letters, he couldn't decide what to do next. 
- The scientist was frozen by his perception of other's perception of himself. Finally, a few weeks later he was freed by news that his collaborator had died with a positive remembrance of him. With his perception of his friend's perception shattered, he was freed. 

## Connections
- This idea reminds me once again of [[Shared realities with different interpretations]] because the scientist and his collaborator experienced his work at the institute very differently. This difference in interpretation caused lots of [[Functional vs unnecessary pain]], mostly unnecessary. If the scientist were more comfortable with conflict, he might have made the pain functional in making it a reason for action.

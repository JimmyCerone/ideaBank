## Idea
- The fewer the symbols available, them ore of them must be transmitted to get across a given amount of information
- Wild amount of [[03062021 - Levers]] here. Kind of like a corrolary to  [[202105131130 - Redundancy, though inefficient, serves as clarification]]
- H = n log s
	- H = amount of information
	- n = number of symbols in the message
	- s = number of symbols available in the language

## Example
- Kele drummers need to be 8X as long as spoken equivalents

Goal setting is a fundamentally illusury way of looking at the world - at least according to Jason Fried of [[Basecamp]]. I have a feeling that the shortcomings of goals is somehow related to [[03-03-2021 - Our language creates our reality]] and [[Shared realities with different interpretations]]. 

We set goals for the person we are now yet we set them for a person we aren't yet.

I'm unsure where my habit stuff falls in here. I don't think it's goals. But it bears more thoughts.

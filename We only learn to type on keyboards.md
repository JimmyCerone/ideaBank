#Problem: we only learn to type on keyboards

- We never learn how to efficiently type on our phone even though we spend tons of time on it. 

## Solution:

- Classes and training and tracking typing speed on phones and kindles. 
	- Adding metrics could be interesting - how hard would this be to implement?
- Use a keyboard (https://tim.blog/2017/06/20/cool-tools-for-travel/)
	- Or jailbreak it if necessary: https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?p=3813938

## Questions
- How much time is wasted because of bad phone typing? 
- How do people who are really good at typing on the phone learn?

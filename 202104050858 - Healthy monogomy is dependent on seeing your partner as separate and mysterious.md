I really struggled with this idea, yet I think it will transform my relationship with [[Liv Panozzo]]. This idea helps me think of our differences and different friends and groups as positives. I think before I had this perception that she would drift away and she will with other friends, but that's actually a positive thing because I get to see her in a new way. 

>  If it is the forbidden that is exciting—if desire is fundamentally transgressive—then the monogamous are like the very rich. They have to find their poverty. They have to starve themselves enough. In other words they have to work, if only to keep what is always too available sufficiently illicit to be interesting.

I think this idea applies in other areas as well, in that to keep doing anything for a long time you have to find ways to see it in a new light. [[Neil]] and I will have to keep this in mind with our project.

## Idea
- I think when most people think of data privacy they talk about, "I don't have anything to hide", but that's not the problem. The problem is that the information you have out there is used to manipulate you using stuff from [[The Power of Habits by Charles Duhigg]]. 
- This is the only counterpoint I've been able to make to [[202103221231 - Privacy is dead]]. I'm increasingly disagreeing with that because we have a long ways to go. Our genes, faces, and more are becoming public with spooky consequences ([[202104222236 - Machine learning is biased.]])

## Example
- [[Perdue]]'s use of prescription data to target areas that have high prescription of painkillers (people with disabilities, etc)

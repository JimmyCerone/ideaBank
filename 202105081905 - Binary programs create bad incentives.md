## Idea
- Systems like welfare are binary - you are on or off. Thus you have a cliff people have to face when dealing with benefits. What we really need is an analog system, much like we need one in education [[202103292344 - The future of education is analog]]. 
- I would love to rethink welfare from the perspective of [[Nudge by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein]] & [[Switch - How to Change Things When Change is Hard by Dan and Chip Heath]]. 
- This is part of why it's so stupid to talk about canceling welfare or food stamps or even cutting them back. It's the exact same problem as gun control in [[Lethal Passage - The Story of a Gun by Erik Larson]] or addiction in [[Dopesick by Beth Macy]]. Once that stuff is out there, you have to do [[042320211016 - Harm Reduction]], not abstinence. 
	- All of this is without mentioning that many people who want to abolish these programs are outsiders and [[202103131903 - The problems that an outsider observes are vastly different than those an insider identifies]] plus are often victims of [[202104211317 - Inductive reasoning is often misused when addressing systemic problems]]. For example, thanks to Ronald Reagan and others, people picture those on welfare as black even though [[Hillbilly Elegy by J.D. Vance]] presents a different vision.

## Example
- Welfare.

## Idea
- Before #History, experience was centered on events not categories of things. 

## Connections
- [[You can write about things you don't understand yet]] is an interesting connection here. I think writing is a way to grasp at the abstract in a way that speaking struggles to do, though being a [[I am a verbal processor]] might contradict that. Though part of the problem I run into with friends and family is that my ideas come out unprocessed. I wonder if it's because I haven't written about them? 

## Examples
- The #Traditional way of naming things and seasons based on events that happen during them (the blood moon, the popping of the trees in the winter)
- The "written" way of perceiving my bedtime routine as an idea I can manipulate and change abstractly rather than an event that happens at night.

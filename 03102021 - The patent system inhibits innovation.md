## Context
- This idea started bubbling up when I was considering it's antithesis: [[03102021 - The patent system does not inhibit innovation]]. 

## Idea
- The book [[The Wright Brothers by David]] gave examples, which I actually found to be counterexamples:
	> The insistence of professor Bell upon his rights did not retard the growth in the use of the telephone
	- This is only kind of true... AT&T was anti-competitive and had a #Monopoly like [[Titan The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.]]. This is well documented in [[The Idea Factory]]. 
	> Thomas Edison's numerous protection of his inventions have not kept any of them out of the market
	- Once again not quite true, though I don't know this as well. Definitely fucked with Tesla and #AC 

## Note
- Got some stuff in Pocket to look into this on [[2021-03-10]].

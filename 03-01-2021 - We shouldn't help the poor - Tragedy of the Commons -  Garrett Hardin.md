## Context
- This came with the source of this idea [[03-01-2021 - Choosing to spend money on non necessities requires you to deal with the opportunity cost of saving a child's life]], but is a completely different article with nearly an opposite tone. At first I thought they were the same article, but looked a second time and realized they had different authors. This author, Hardin, came up with the idea of the Tragedy of the commons. 

Hardin argues that the world can be thought of as a life boat with limited #Resources. The more people we try to help the more we put the whole life boat at risk. His argument is basically that we are above #CarryingCapacity and the only way to avoid sinking is to keep #Wealth where it is and avoid giving it away. 

Based on my reading of [[Growth by Vaclov Smil]] and [[Factfulness]], I'm pretty sure he's wrong on a lot of points. First, he's using the #Assumptions of Thomas Malthus, who got the #Growth rate of food sources wrong. Second, he got the population growth rates wrong. Third, he's wrong in dividing the world into rich and poor as [[Factfulness]] convincingly showed.

## Reflections
- Basically all of [[Superintelligence]] is this and [[Psionica]] is built around it as well. Hopefully, this is what [[Neil]] and I will do, solving unknown unknowns as I put it in [[Shawn Crowley]] and I's meeting notes. 
- An interesting layer on top of this is that the questions aren't hard to come up with. Kids come up with questions that contemplate unknown unknowns all the time. 
	- What's interesting is that what follows from this idea, is that it wouldn't be hard to automate this process. That's what K-probes does.

## Work 
- Trying to remember where we left off yesterday. I know things were broken, but I don't remember what. I think maybe we have to write some tests? I think we have fixed the highlighting problem from yesterday but the calculations for the far left are off - not because of rounding errors? 
- The issue is [[FUS-1676 - A user can override a price record while price editing - Frontend]].


Had the #Design meeting today which was quite fun, notes are at [[Meeting for Design Series for Feb 19, 2021]].

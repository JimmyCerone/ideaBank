## Todo
- [ ] Learn about domain mapping

#February #TwentyTwentyOne

## Progress
- Finished review on [[FUS-1646 A User can override a price record while price editing backend]].
- Presented Jori and I's project: [[Notes on Jimmy & Jori's Solution]] and watched Patrick and Lauren's: [[Notes on Lauren & Patrick's Solution]]

## Questions
- [x] Ask Jordan about checking for null at event.ts level instead of on the logic and calculation logic levels
	- [x] Ask Jordan about returning null from the entity - why?
		- If someone chooses a classifiation from the drop down, we set the id and there is a rate associated with it. If someone overrides it, we will have to recalculate the markup which will not be in the drop down. If there is no overridden markup, it will use the markup. Designated can be null because they default to standard. 
- [x] Ask Jordan about calculation specifics on the sandbox test and run the proposed fix by him. 
- [x] Ask Andy about nesting in graphql

## Learning
- Asked Jordan about nesting in graphql and realized it was similar to using a single input. It allows you to change stuff in the background without changing the number of fields which would break stuff. Source: [[Designing GraphQL Mutations]]
- Learned about the magic of Formik, though I don't understand it. Somehow it pipes things between each other to transfer conrexts?

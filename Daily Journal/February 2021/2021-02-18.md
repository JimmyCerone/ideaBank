## Questions
- How much more do we have to do on the [[FUS-1676 - A user can override a price record while price editing - Frontend]] story? As far as I can recall we have the dropdown done and the calculations are looking correct. Do we still have tests to write? 
- Seems like there isn't much left to do after examining the latest commit. 

## Notes
- Not sure I have much to do after work today. Wanna put some stuff in here. Wanna read instead of watching TV (not sure how well that will go). Wanna respond to cherish and send steph and mal messages.

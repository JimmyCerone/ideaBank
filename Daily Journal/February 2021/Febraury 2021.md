#February #TwentyTwentyOne
## The Good
- Lots of fun times with Liv. The weekends were a blast. We did a great job of staying connecting and being intentional with the time we had. 
	- Skiing
	- Dinner at 40 acres
- Started using obsidian in earnest and it helped motivate lots of reading
- Started quitting and cutting back on stuff, implemented the Want to Do Trello board which has been a life saver. 
- Loved reading Genghis Kahn and realized history is something I want to do a deep dive on for the foreseeable future. 
- Began automating my finances
- Redid my room, added the calendar, and moved the living room around. 
- Created a new plan for sharing knowledge and writing centered around friends rather than publishing and making $

## The Bad
- Work was super hard. Jordan and I got stuck on a story for almost the entirety of the month and I barely got to drive at all. Worked out a solution for me to drive in the morning that only lasted a few days because we got so behind. 
- Slept less than I should and watched more TV than I wanted to. Had trouble exercising without Blue
- Ear clogged up and lost my hearing for half a day
- Got sick and had to spend a week alone which set me onto some bad TV habits and the loneliness was bad...
- Jake attempted suicide. I wish I knew of more ways to help. 
- Felt like I lost contact with friends and fell behind in keeping up. 
	- In particular Cherish and Mal

## Reflections
- Super expensive month but the quarterly bonus saved my ass.

## Work
- Paired with Meredith to fix bugs pointed out by Ryan. 
	- Fixed the first bug
	- Still working on the second bug
		- Second bug is outside of our scope - a role problem / misalignment. 
- This afternoon I have to do sprint planning, using [[Meeting with Ryan  Sprint Demo]] as a guide as well as my notes from [[Sprint Demo Feb 3 2021]]. 
	- Started my notes for this sprint demo here: [[Sprint Demo March 17 2021]]
- Finally got around to reading the stuff on graphql and made a nice write up here: [[03172021 - Graphql Resolver]]. 
- Loved working today. Fun to have my own thang - sprint demo. Also fun to see what happened this sprint.

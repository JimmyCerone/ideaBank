Had trouble today because the build process is being weird. All kinds of weird errors when adding a local sales item on [[FUS-1960 - Hierarchy Assignments not publishing with sandbox publish]]. Meredith thinks it's old code stuck somewhere on there. I hope it's this and not some weird error I caused. Frustrating day over all. 

Today has not been good work wise. Broken flappy tests keep failing my branch and my `yarn dev` keeps failing with `SIGABRT`. Oh calamity. 

From version 4 -> 5 with webpack, instead of passing in an object, you have to pass in a list of regexes. Some of the API changes are a reduction of features, in particular, node compilation. Supports a certain version of ecma script modules and forces other libraries that you can bring in as plugins to get upgraded to their latest versions. So this is like Apple making M1 - a major, breaking version upgrade. There is some stuff in our material ui library that works in 4 but not 5. Webpack takes our nice looking imports and makes them "real". Node modules are weird because they are transpiled js already, but they are setup for the format of webpack 4. Our date pickers would blow up on Webpack 5. It was on version 3 and there is no version 5 edition because it got depracated and moved to material ui but updated. So it's not compatible. So to make webpack 5 we need to totally revamp our date pickers.

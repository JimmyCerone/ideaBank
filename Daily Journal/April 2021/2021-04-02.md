## Work
Half day today but a very frustrating one. keep getting this test failure on [[FUS-1953 - When adding a Market to a Product on the Edit Product page while in a Sandbox, the new Market only appears after refreshing the page.]] that I can't replicate locally but keeps popping up remotely. Not sure what to do about it and everyone is out haha. So ended up just tooling around and finding jira stories / reading pocket articles. Which was nice but would have been nicer to be done with that damn story.

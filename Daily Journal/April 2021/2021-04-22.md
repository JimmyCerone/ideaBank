## Work
- Learned about inversion today - removing negatives. What are negatives at work that I can remove to improve my days? 

## Reflections
- Really kind of bummed about going to work. I tried waking up early today to get going and write (started at 8) but I think I'd rather start earlier and finish earlier. I don't seem to have great energy in the morning. Much better at like 4...
- Struggling badly to stay focused. Dislike my desk at the moment, not liking to sit. Not sure quite whats going on rn. So freaking cold which is part of it. My hands are having trouble on the keys and kinda going numb. 
- Still little improvement. The URL story seems very boring and we can't replicate it on local or review environments, only on production. Also, dynamo db is super hard to search

Read [[Hyperfocus Through Deep Work]] and want to talk to [[Jesse Hill]] about this at our coaching today. 

Finding interesting problems on [[FUS-1960 - Hierarchy Assignments not publishing with sandbox publish]] after many people helped get my environment back up and running [[2021-04-07]]. 

Really feeling stuck on 1960 now. There is a failure on Cypress, which I don't really understand. Plus everything is going so slow. Tired of waiting for builds. 

Feel really bad about doing taxes and other stuff while watching the Dance concert. It was hard to watch alone and kind of depressing to be alone like that. I wish I'd hooked up my computer to the TV and plopped on the couch. It was a bad idea to watch it on my computer. But alas. I got a lot done, which I'm happy about. Taxes are finished which is quite nice. Ah blast it. Adulting is so much random work.

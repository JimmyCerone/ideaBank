		- Is it a data issue?
			- Was working the first half of Thursday but then stopped working before / after I ran the jde loading script
			- Works for new Local Sales Items but not for existing items
			- Seems to be a data issue as this works just fine on Meredith's device

## Work

#### Review Script Issue

##### What Do We Know
- There was a preexisting issue on this from Friday -> Monday (https://amwayawr.slack.com/archives/G01FV2HDYJU/p1618835246220100)
	- It was allegedly resolved this morning. 
- TablePlus
	- Jimmy can't connect but Meredith can. 
		- Jimmy can now connect - VPN had dropped out on him
- Scripts
	- Neither `yarn db:migrate:latest` nor `price-editing-setup` works - both are giving us timeout errors

##### What We Discovered
- We were using the wrong database url the whole time. So everything is fine except that so far running the scripts has not fixed the COS errors

##### Questions
- Where is the problem?
	- Connection Error
	- Database error
		- Errors were report this morning and it has 32 CU right now, which is weird and there is no record of that change
			- Update: There is a record of the change, it was pinned to 32 CU to avoid auto-scaling. 
	- Review environment 
		- Blown up / out of date -> unlikely since we were able to see it just fine
		- Review environment data was out of date - I forgot to run an important script.

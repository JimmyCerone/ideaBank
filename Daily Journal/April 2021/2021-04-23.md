## Work
- Working on [[FUS-1890 - Users may have links or saved preferences that are broken]] today, probably want to sync with Jason. 

## Reflections
- Very good day. Great talk with [[Shawn Crowley]] and exciting talk with [[Jesse Hill]] about the Ambassador idea. Things are looking up and getting exciting. Fusion was good as well, finished [[FUS-1890 - Users may have links or saved preferences that are broken]] and [[FUS-2023 - Price Edit Summary does not take into account Annual Total Units]] today which is dope af. Starting [[FUS-1991 - Pre-Filter Edit Products page to the Sandbox Market]] at the end of the day. 
- Very excited to see Liv tonight, missed her deeply recently.

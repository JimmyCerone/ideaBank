## Reflection
- Kind of bummed to be working solo. Hard to get unstuck and figure out what's going on. Kind of worn down. 

Really enjoyed our meeting about [[Quarter 2 2021]] - tons of exciting stuff about startups. I think this could be part of my unique value at [[Atomic Object]] - my relationship with the startup culture in the area. 

Was super stressed about restoring the review environment but everyone was so nice and helpful. Learned a lot which was great bud didn't get much work done on [[FUS-1944 - Edit Products page geography filter not filtering new local products]] though I have a good lead.

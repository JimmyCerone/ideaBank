Feeling a little slow this morning. 

## Work 
Lots of problems today. Yarn build is not working no matter how much memory I allocate. apt-get is crashing my testing remote. So I have no testing. 

Review is in trouble as well. Phew. Craziness. But on the bright side [[FUS-1944 - Edit Products page geography filter not filtering new local products]] might be fixed if we can ever test it. Ok I was using the flag instead of the environment variable on yarn build and after fixing that, the tests pass!

Worked on a fun issue ([[FUS-2001 - Price Edit Summary should always display in local currency]]) that had me back at the front and back end intersection. 

## TODO 
- [ ] check tests that meredith updated from [[FUS-1944 - Edit Products page geography filter not filtering new local products]]

## Therapy

## TODO
- [ ] [[FUS-2001 - Price Edit Summary should always display in local currency]] is a bit more complicated than we thought
	- [ ] Fix the query for the summary on the Price Edit Table
		- [ ] Look around to see if this error is present in more places
- [ ] Formatting issues in the sandbox info drawer: https://jira.amway.com:8443/browse/FUS-2017
- [ ] Price Edit Issue: https://jira.amway.com:8443/browse/FUS-2016
- [x] Cost Issues
	- Cost fields should either all be editable or none
		- This works for corporate sourced items, but not for affiliate sourced items (only Other Affiliate COS is editable)
	- [x] Setup meeting to better understand where cost data comes from
		- Jeff George, Justin DeHoop and Jeff Van Dyke
		- Who else do we need? 


## Meeting Outcomes
- [ ] Nora will review requirements on 1727
- [ ] We will make a code change on the DBO importer process so that the CostLastUpdatedBy isn't set to JDE.
	- [ ] Then rerun sourcing and import process

## Reflections
- Really enjoyed getting a drink with [[Matt Farmer]] - fun to talk to someone as well read as I am

## Work
- Tomorrow we will wrap up [[FUS-2023 - Price Edit Summary does not take into account Annual Total Units]] and get testing instructions written for the review team. Then we can continue testing [[FUS-1890 - Users may have links or saved preferences that are broken]] and resolving that error. 

## Reflections
- Good day overall - stayed over at [[Liv Panozzo]] last night and got more sleep than last night. Fun to hang out on her birthday. This morning got some good writing in about [[202104200859 - Chat is a greedy form of communication]] which I hope to turn into an article at some point. That hoped for article pile is growing by the day, want to finish [[202103302255 - Constructive noncomformist]] article soon. That will clear up some space for the unbundling phone stuff. Work was good nice to finally get some heads down time and dig into code once again. Still miss writing up whole features but alas, bugs are my domain.

Took the morning off and started work on the afternoon. Was confused, which was embarrasing, but proud that I got up the courage to ask for help quickly and got back on track after help from Meredith. Very fun story today - learn a lot about the event management system we use to kick off actions and how it connects to sandboxes. 

Fun reading today [[Crucial Conversations by Patterson and Company]]. I really love the concepts in this book - I've already learned a lot. Working through the examples was revealing because it showed just how little I know... My favorite part is about getting on the same page and avoiding making the argument about the details.

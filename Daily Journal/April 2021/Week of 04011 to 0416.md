Limiting the number of articles I could bookmark worked like a charm. Yet another idea from [[Liv Panozzo]] and her beautiful mind. 

## Experiments
[[Limit my consumption of books and articles]] update worked like a charm as seen above. Lots of fun stuff coming through the pipeline though I'm still having a hard time finding time to read articles. Will have to figure that out in a future experiment. Printing them doesn't seem to work and reading them on my Phone is bad because it's hard to capture the ideas (though voice is helpful) and the time intervals are so short. My attention span kind of sucks. Maybe I could schedule time in once a week to read? Maybe Wednesday? Going to try that before writing. [[Create weekly time to read articles]].

The daily workout experiment is going great. Loving it - though "scheduling" time to go get my prize isn't working super well. Ah whatever. Works well enough and doesn't merit more optimizing. Can't wait for the kindle!

## Books
- Started listening to [[Dopesick by Beth Macy]], which I was devouring until my phone broke. Fascinating look at the opiod crisis, which was so much worse than I expected and had way more history. 
- Started reading [[The Autobiography of Malcolm X by Malcolm X]]. Such an interesting look at him, I knew so so little about him and in particular Marcus Garvey, who I thought was further back in #History but was around in the 20's and 30's. 
- Started reading [[The Art of Gathering by Priya Parker]] and I've been super impressed. Both this book and [[Crucial Conversations by Patterson and Company]] have me thinking more deeply about the questions I need to ask before I head blindly into conversations.  
## Rose 
- Work is coming more easily and my confidence level is on 10
- Folks are recognizing and utilizing my talents at work more than ever before.
- Slayed the Demo at work and worked well with Nora throughout the week, providing lots of confidence.
- Fun planning Liv's birthday stuff, very excited to see all of it in action. 
- Got out on my bike a few times which was an absolute blast. 
- Saw Liv on Thursday and got to go out for food and ice cream. Then got to sleep over which was so nice. So good to see her and Blue...
## Bud 
- Tough conversations with [[Liv Panozzo]] [[2021-04-11]] made me rethink how I talk to Liv and how to handle my boundaries in the future (especially after a conversation with [[Aaron Reider]]).
- Loving the learning I was able to do with [[Quantum Country by Andu Mutaschak and Michael Nielson]] - so fun to be doing basic learning again and fun to see math like linear algebra again.
- Got lots of ideas about unbundling my phone thanks to it being broken.
- Great conversation with Father Charlie [[2021-04-13]] that gave me great ideas for reengaging with the Bible. 
- The stress of the week resulted in tons of learning - tons more confidence in processes at work and working with AWS.
- Setup lots of exciting meetings for the next couple of weeks.
## Thorn
- Lots of stress at work in advance of testing with India. 
- UAT Channel got out of control at work, so many issues ([[UAT Testing Issues]])
- Felt slow and tired as the week went on. Lonely after day 3...
- Therapy was good but tough. Not looking forward to some conversations.
- Phone broke + tons of trips to the Apple store. 
- The internet seemed broken this week from AWS to CodeBuild.

Had a tough conversation with [[Liv Panozzo]] last night into today. She said because I haven't told her about my emotions and I've instead told her all the information I learn, she worries about my state and can't relax. This takes the fun out of our relationship and leads her to think she can't trust me. 

I don't like to burden people and that's why I don't talk about it. I thought that I was telling her about me when I talked about information, but I see I'm telling her content and not conditions. 

We also talked about marriage and agreed to table the discussion for a while as she's stressed and worried about it with her career looming and uncertain. 

Also learned about [[Orbit]] and decided I'm going to put quantum computing at the top of my list for learning about during work breaks. Might have to let it replace Vyper (almost done with the tutorial anyway). Just finished vyper so quantum country it is!

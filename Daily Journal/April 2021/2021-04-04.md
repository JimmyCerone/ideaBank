Walked to the Blue Bridge with [[Liv Panozzo]] and talked about the need for more urge surfing from me so I'm less intrusive. Also talked about an increased need for me to be direct about my needs (especially for alone time) and telling her the plan (or lack therefor) before hand. lots of learning. Talked as well about my article obsession and I implemented [[Limit my consumption of books and articles]].

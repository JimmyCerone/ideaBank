## Work
Worked on [[FUS-1991 - Pre-Filter Edit Products page to the Sandbox Market]] to no avail. For some reason the state isn't getting passed down correctly and nor is yarn dev working. 

So it seems to be working on yarn dev, but cypress busted at the end of the day for me. !

## Reflections
- Need to be more assertive about pairing. Today was rough because of lots of interruptions and not feeling like I got to pair much. Worked long to get the chance to code. I miss it. 
- I form really strict rules for myself then get tired of them then break them. 
	- How can I function other than this?
- Let go of daily habits and go to number of times a week
	- Do this for the 5 things
		1. Walk
		2. Read
		3. Write
		4. Meditate 
		5. Create

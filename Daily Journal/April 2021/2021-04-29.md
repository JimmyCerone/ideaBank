## Work
- Today I will be tackling a new story, [[FUS-2011 - Export of Report table in the context of Sandbox does not include Sandbox updates]]. Kinda excited to dive into a new part of the codebase. Feeling quite stuck with this. maybe I can take a deeper dive into the query and resolver? 

## Reflections
- Getting my second COVID vaccine shot today, little worried about side effects. But so so excited to finally stop worrying about COVID. Work was so so hard. Felt very alone, missing the office.

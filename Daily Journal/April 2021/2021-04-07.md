Trying to fix my scripts, which were blown away when editing the server config file. Without the scripts I can't run yarn test or yarn db:do-over:test. Beyond frustrated at this point. Embarrassed and confused and feeling super not productive. Yarn build should fix it but it keeps blowing up with SIGABRT. 

## What Worked
- Killing all processes
- Running `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space0-size=8192`
	- The problem is that Docker alone takes up 10 GB of my ram so if I'm running docker, I can't run `yarn build`
	- Fails when I try to run with 1.5 G instead of 8. So I'm flat out of RAM here. 

## What to try next
- [x] New computer (Linux back end) - Jordan
	- [ ] AWS or Cloud instead?
- [x] Run the yarn build commands sequentially instead of concurrently

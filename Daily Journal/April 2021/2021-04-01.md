Working with Meredith today but also have the demo in the afternoon. Today starts April! Budget did not go well last month but the Stimulus check will help that out? Not sure quite what to do with that, might look next Wednesday. Not sure about what to do with the calendar wall. 

## Today

Ended up working on 1953 and then will be moving to 1949 once done.

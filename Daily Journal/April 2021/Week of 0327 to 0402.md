## Rose
- Got a bike! And got to see [[Liv Panozzo]] again after being at home for a week. 
- Two negative COVID tests and a scheduled vaccine!
- Felt great about work - turned a corner! Demos are going great and I'm feeling like a productive team member!

## Thorn
- Freaking out about having COVID and then finding out I'm a hypochondriac was not super fun - [[2021-03-31]]. 
- Stressing about unpacking and being crabby was also not fun: [[2021-03-28]].
- Not reading because I'm stressed about having to put it into Obsidian sucks. Also not having a Kindle sucks. 

## Bud
- Being home was weird, but I think I got a lot out of it in terms of perspective on how I want to reflect on the past. [[Choosing to filter ideas rather than rejecting people]] was an idea that taught me a lot here. 
- Reading and writing in the morning is something I don't do often, but love when I do. Want to figure out how to do it consistently at some point: [[2021-03-29]].
- Found a potential alternative to the Pocket issue. Now everything I pocket every week gets sent to me in a weekly email, my very own newsletter. Might even send it to people.

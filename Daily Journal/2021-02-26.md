#February #TwentyTwentyOne
## Reflections
- Working solo last night left me super motivated. See the entry in the [[Good Time Journal]]. 
- Talking with Jesse was great - feel way better about knowing nothing as I'm not meant to. Keep having to relearn that. Going to scale back my efforts to change #AtomicObject and just learn what it's like here for a while and what it means to be a dev. Very reassuring to hear that Jesse isn't obsessed with coding either and chose it to make a living instead of doing it as a passion. Glad to know you can survive at Atomic like that. More thoughts here: [[One on One Meeting Notes]]. 
- The Design activity was also awesome, so cool to see so many practical tools out there for improving design. Want to start integrating this with Neil and I's work - maybe we could add an end user to obsidian?? More can be found here: [[Meeting for Design Series Feb 26, 2021]].
- #Blue got neutered yesterday but seems to be doing great. Very groggy, but good overall.

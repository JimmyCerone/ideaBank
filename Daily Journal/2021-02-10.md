## Work
- What I learned at work can be found in this article: [[Designing GraphQL Mutations]]

## TODO 
- [ ] Product Number for Price Edit Report test
- [ ] Ask Jordan about checking for null at event.ts level instead of on the logic and calculation logic levels
	- [ ] Ask Jordan about returning null from the entity - why?
- [ ] Ask Jordan about calculation specifics on the sandbox test and run the proposed fix by him. 
- [ ] Ask Andy about nesting in graphql

## Notes
- We need a calculator for this project because the tests are impossible to update without it.

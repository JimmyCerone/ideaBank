## Reflections
- Kinda spacey this morning. Forgot to meditate again - it's hard without my chair at home. Bummed about my budget blowing up this month. Not super fun stuff. Felt weird about getting the bike earlier than I wanted to but in the end I think it will work out. Just got to make it to the end of this month...
- Finished a bunch of books recently which was great but forgot lots of stuff while I was at it. Hard living with two dogs because it's hard to do things for myself sometimes. 
- Wrote about gun violence today. Very shaken up by it all and how we haven't woken up to it. 
- Published a story about search engines that i thought would blow up but hasn't still really like it though.

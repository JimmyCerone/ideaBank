## Reflections
- Working through [[FUS-1892 - BVABO Price (Less Tax) Ratio is not a dropdown for new local items]] today - weir test failures that I couldn't figure out yesterday is what I will be addressing. 
- Starting at 8:30 again today - nice to have some morning time to myself. I like having my alarm set as default to 8:30 and then having the ability to wake up before knowing I have that backstop if I need to sleep in. I want to wake up when I wake up though. It is not fun to wake up and go back to sleep for an extra 20 minutes. It does little to wake me up more and leaves me with less time.

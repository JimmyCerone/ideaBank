## Reflection
- Tired but enjoyed writing stuff up in the morning before work. Almost enjoy that more than reading in the morning. Nice midpoint between work and play. 
- Just heard from [[Liv Panozzo]] that her roommate tested positive. Very worried for her and me and everything. Got a test today (way easier to schedule than last time) and will hear back in 24 - 48 hours which is dope but probably have to take a second test because it takes a while to incubate. Almost out of vitamin D and unsure how to get more. Wonder where her roommate got COVID from...

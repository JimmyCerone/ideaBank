## Reflection
- Hanging out with the dogs is both frustrating and fun. Rolled around like a dog which both of them seemed to really enjoy. It's all about attention for them. What percentage am I giving? They can detect that really well, how engaged I am. Humans can too, but are more coy about letting on. 
- Curious about how this jam session is going to go - first conversations are often hard. Remarkably, I'm not worried as I usually am about the pressure to talk after this. We will or we won't and I can always ask for something less intrusive like email.

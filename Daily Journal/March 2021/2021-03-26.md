## Reflections
### Work
- Loved the meetings today, as I do every Friday. Super spacey the rest of the day - still having a hard time when I feel out of my depth. Really missed my desk as it helps keep me centered. Never realized how much I relied on my environment to get work done. My apartment isn't the best but not bad. 

### Dogs
- Great today - they played outside till like noon. Just loving the outdoors today. I went out with them later in the day and it was just perfect. Killer temperature. Went on a tandem walk, which are quickly becoming some of my favorite things in the world. Just adds a ton to the fun. Now the two dogs are cashed out around the living room which just makes my heart swell.

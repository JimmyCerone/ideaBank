## Reflections
- Felt terrible last night and almost passed out. Then I ate a lot and felt better. Liv said that might be a coping thing, which bears thinking. I feel really bad for putting her through that. Not sure what's going on, I just know that I get very uncomfortable with other people around when I'm not feeling well. I just want to be alone or I exagerate. I do not feel like myself when I'm like that. Still feeling off today though, not as bad as I thought. Can still taste, but am fatigued.  Got my test done, feeling ok. Screens are no good for me right now. 

## Tech Time
- Working on related issues: 
	- https://github.com/AmwayEFS/fusion-platform/issues/483
	- https://github.com/AmwayEFS/fusion-platform/issues/490


They bring up all kinds of extra issues that are fascinating and frustrating. 

## Questions
- At what level should I change this? Should I alter the isomorphism file?
	- I think I do need to make the changes at that level, it takes the string list and transforms it into a string list (I think): `modules/helpers/isomorphisms.ts`
- Where does this get passed to a query? Is it expecting a list?
- How does the whole filter situation work? Do we even use a query at all? 
	-	We are getting stuff via the PriceEditSideBar or priceEditReportState... So whatever those take as an input is what we need to get to. I'm guessing that's a list but want to make sure.

#March #TwentyTwentyOne 

# Start

## Goals
- Start #Writing again in a calmer way using the mind map (once it is up and running again)
- Strengthen creative exchanges with friends
- Start some type of workout a few days a week outside of walking


## Books
- King Leopold's Ghost (Carryover)
- Wheel of Time
- The Innovators?
- James Cone?

For some reason I'm not reading on the Kindle hardly at all. Almost all my reading comes from "real" books and audio books. I think I'm either going to focus on those two mediums or buy a Kindle. 

# End

# Goals
- Started writing again which was boss as fuck. Had an article featured on Medium's front page of tech. Gotta figure out how to do the knowledge management more sustainably. Been reading so many articles haven't had time for books. 
- This went so so well. Isaac and Joe have been great creative partners. 
- Finally started working out. Goal is to do this all of April for a Kindle!

## Books
- Finished King Leopold's Ghost which was fantastic. Slowing down after a heavy week of reading. 
- Tried to read innovators again and struggled. Hate reading on the kindle app, so James Cone is probably going to have to wait as well.

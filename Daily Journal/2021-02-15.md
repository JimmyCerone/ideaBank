#February #TwentyTwentyOne
## Work
- Continuing work on [[FUS 1676 - A user can override a price record while price editing - Frontend]], finding it hard without Jordan again, though this weekend was restful and I have a surprising amount of energy today. 
- Actually asked for help (added this to the [[Success Table]]) today with Jordan out today, getting out ahead of it for once. 
	- Was not able to get help. Really good in the morning to work alone as I had stuff to do and people to talk to but now it's getting slow and stressful. Trying to distract myself from the fact I feel way out of my depth. Getting better dealing with that, taking breaks as necessary and reaching out / making things simple and breaking them down. More can be found in the [[Failure Table]]. 
- The RenderFormikCell component is difficult to decipher, very complicated. 
- Today's work was not bad at all - getting help at key check in points makes a huge difference. Working through struggles seems to be helpful, but there is a point at which it isn't useful. The problem seems to identifying the right time to reach out for help. It seems like when I'm distracted more than 2 or 3 times that's about the sweet spot.

#February #TwentyTwentyOne
## Plan
- Work on [[FUS 1676 - A user can override a price record while price editing - Frontend]]
	- Don't remember where we left off. Finally made a plan to solve this problem in the [[Failure Table]].
	- Finally figured it out. We were testing the tests and had only changed 1 mutation, all the rest are commented out. 
	- Got 8 more mutations to update, Jordan is out for the day. Gotta keep my distraction rules in mind. Taking Ivy out is a great distraction / break for when I'm worn out, but not great when I need help. Don't forget to ask for help!!
	- I'm seeing some weird behavior with rounding.

## Schedule
- [[Tech Refinement]]
- Aaron
	- Want to pick up the conversation about lack of agency with my family
	- Want to talk about my addiction to information and my connection with my grandpa's murder
		- So worn out by talking about this. 
- Neil
	- Won't finish reading but want to get closer between 5 & 6 and during breaks from work. Want to take a couple 5 - 10 minute breaks throughout the day to read

## Things to Know
- read [[Head First SQL]]
- [[Getting Things Done/Kanban Projects/Digital Minimalism]]

## Read Something
- What did I read today?
	- Read some of [[Getting Things Done by David Allen]], which is slowly growing less useful. I was able to fly through a lot of it - might be best done as a skimmer where I take what I need and move on. 
	- Also read a lot of [[Head First SQL]], almost done! I think I will finish up by the end of June, as planning, which is very exciting. Learned a ton in this last chapter, might even just call it because of the fact the security doesn't seem to be used on our project. But one more 20 page section shouldn't be bad at all so maybe I'll finish it after all!

## Write Something
- What did I write today? 
	- No, not sure I will get to that. [[Cold Turkey]] Writer though is a game changer. Have a lot I want to write about, including some about Juneteenth. I think I want to start taking my writing into more social justice and personal directions. Not sure if I want to post that to [[Medium]] or elsewhere. Need to sit down and think about that soon. 

## Give Thanks
- Saw another #BlueHeron today on my way back from the dog park (or was it to there?). Or did I see it yesterday? Anyhow I'm thankful for that and for a wonderful day where I felt more at home than I have in quite a while.

## Give Thanks
- It was both nice and stressful to have blue in the office. I'm glad to have him here because I can work shorter days and hang out with him, though I think both of us are a little nervous here. The office is not quite as dog lovers as I thought - everyone is very work focused which I should have expected. And turns out not everyone was super hype about Carl's dogs all the time so it's all more complex than I expected. Everyone seems to like Blue though.

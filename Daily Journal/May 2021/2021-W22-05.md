## Favorite Article
I'm surprised to say this but it was [[Why two Clockwise designers built a video game that gives humans empathy for machines by Cathy Reisenwitz]]. I expected it to be a kind of low quality article but there was actually a ton of good ideas in there and it keeps popping up again and again in new ideas. Rapidly becoming one of my more connected articles of late. 

## Books
- [[Zero to One by Peter Thiel]]
- [[Punished by Rewards by Alfie Kohn]]
- [[The Information - A History, A Theory, A Flood by james Gleick]]
- [[Head First SQL]]

## Favorite Book
[[Punished by Rewards by Alfie Kohn]] stands out because it is remaking so much of my mind but [[The Information - A History, A Theory, A Flood by james Gleick]] is a close second. Wish I could find more time to read it... [[Zero to One by Peter Thiel]] was a very mixed bag. 

## Ideas
- [[202105241934 - Energy can be converted into information]]

- [[202105271417 - Perceived effort is not linear]]
- [[202105281215 - Will power is a generalizable and trainable skill]]
- [[202105291019 - The size of a problem and it's solution are asymmetrical]]

## Favorite Idea
Tie between [[202105271417 - Perceived effort is not linear]] and [[202105291019 - The size of a problem and it's solution are asymmetrical]]. I've just kept running into these as roadblocks for my mental health. It's nice to get down in words why the beliefs I have are not accurate.

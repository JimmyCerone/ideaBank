## Reflections
- Was trying to figure out why I was struggling so much staying up late reading and watching movies. I think after reflection, it occurs when I'm lonely and burnt out. Not sure if I can tease out which that is, but based on my past it's probably burn out. [[I recover from burnout with stories]].

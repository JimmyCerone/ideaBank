## Read Something
- What did I read today?
	- Reading [[Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport]] and loving it so far. Dovetails so nicely with so many of the experiments I have been trying and is encouraging me in my desire to drop the [[Apple]] iPhone and get a Lightphone. 

## Write Something
- What did I write today? 
	- Lots of things to write about in [[Atlassian]]'s Trello. Really liking what is coming out of [[Getting Things Done by David Allen]] and [[Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport]]. Makes me want to write about at least one of those systems. 

## Give Thanks
- Really wanted to give thanks to the land we built [[Atomic Object]] on today for some reason. Wild to imagine all that it provides for us. Also thinking lots about Proposition 3 and sending prayers to the Anishabe who are out their fighting for their treaty rights.

## TODO
- Working on [[FUS-1995 - Editing product root and MPV info from product management area]] and finding that I have so much to learn about abilities and user roles. 

## Reflections
- Feeling very stuck. I have no idea where to start with tests as I'm not even quite sure where this stuff lives. Maybe I could start with the edit pricing page? 
- Looks like the story above is going to be super distributed. The tests seem to be all over the app. The best thing I think I can do is try to figure out what abilities correspond to what.

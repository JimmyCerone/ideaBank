## Good Thing Today
- Taking the dogs out was easier than expected

## Free Write
- Super stressed about getting to work on time, getting my hours in, and being without my dog. Really struggling with in person work on those metrics, plus finding myself more tired than usual post work. Kind of missing remote work in an odd way. I think I'd rather work solo if remote, but prefer pair programming in person. Though I guess [[Tuple]] changes the equation a little bit. If I were to take a remote job, tooling would be a huge deal for me.
- Taking the dogs out discovered a few tricks:
	- Lock my bike by the 3rd floor stairs during lunch for easy access (keep putting it on second floor for night and morning)
	- Let the dogs play in the apartment first (makes walking them later easier)
- The above two improvements made the most frustrating parts of the experience disappear with the added benefit of giving me a short window to eat and do random research (looked into [[Forrester]] today)
- Thinking a lot about LA and jobs as a result.

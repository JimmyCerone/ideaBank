## Reflections
- Work was good - I got better at accepting when I'm not needed. When lydia and jordan and i are working together, I'm kind of unecessary and it was nice to just relax. then in the afternoon i got good work done. It was nice to be accepting of myself today, finishing the [[The Wheel of Time]] book helped a lot. Interesting to see what Rand realized and apply it to my own life. Probably time to slow down.

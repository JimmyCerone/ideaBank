This long tail is predicted by [[Black Swan by Nassim Taleb]] and has #Asymmetric outcomes. 

Retailers benefit hugely because they sell the aggregate of the long tail, which can be huge. 

Consumers benefit hugely because they can get whatever crazy niche item they want. 

Creators lose because the tail doessn't increase sales much, but adds tons of competition and downward pressure on prices. 

One way to avoid this spiral it to curate your own tail with [[1000 True Fans]].

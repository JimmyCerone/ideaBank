From the [[202103291336 - The Episode of Everything - Balaji on Bitcoin]] a fascinating idea about transforming #Education using concepts from #Cryptocurrency. The idea is here that you make education analog by using Proof of Skill with exercises instead of a single degree. The theory goes that it takes 2500 problems solved to get a CS degree at Stanford. But what if it wasn't binary? What if 500 problems qualified you for some work and 1000 required you for even better work? That's what is happening at 1729.com and even exercism.io where you can skill up incrementally instead of step wise.

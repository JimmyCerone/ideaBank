I think part of the reason some organizations, especially #Religious ones (see [[If I Were an Abuser, What Church Would I Want to Attend]]), attract so many abusive #Personality is because of the inherent power imbalances. You see it as well with [[King Leopold's Ghost]]. Who were the soldiers who went there? People seeking #Power. They knew they could have it there. Where there is a power imbalance, it is highly likely you will find abusers, who further that power imbalance. It is a #FeedbackLoop.

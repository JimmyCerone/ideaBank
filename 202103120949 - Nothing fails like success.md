## Second Draft
This idea is from [[Crucial Conversations]]. The idea is that you can sum up all of #History in these four words. 
> When a challenge in life is met by a response that is equal to it, you have success. But when the challenge moves to a higher level, the old, once successful response no longer works - it fails; thus nothing fails like success.

I forget where this came from and I'm having trouble grasping the #Idea. I think the basics are that when you are successful, you often have to change #Strategies which is counterintuitive. You often then stick with your original strategy, which leads to #Failure.

This is kind of a Greek idea, with the old philosophers #Ideas about forms and breaking things down into #Atomic parts. In a way, this concept is at the center of [[The Atomic Web Note Taking Strategy - Zettelkasten]]. By identifying independent parts, or uncorrelated bets in [[Principles by Ray Dalio]] language, you can reduce #Risk and solve the problem more effectively. The Wright brothers did this by focusing on #Balance before adding a motor in [[The Wright Brothers by David]]. The idea of [[03062021 - Levers]] is basically this, I did it by breaking up my gas bill into 3 unrelated parts and optimizing each separately.

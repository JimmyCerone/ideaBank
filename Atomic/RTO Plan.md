- Staying collocated
		- Problem:
			- Shawn and Mike don't see this as a change. 
			- Basically we have this problem [[202105051416 - Aiming at the Rider gives direction but not motivation]] because they think people already have motivation. 
				- People are experiencing this as a loss, not a gain.
				- "We just want to get back to where we were then we can experiment" is being interpreted as, "Give up all your leverage and then we will talk about"
				- Why does leadership feel so strongly about this?
					- Consistent problem where leadership feels like they are being super thoughtful and therefore deserve trust. 
						- The problem is that since we haven't been collocated trust has decayed. 
							- Therefore, we need to fix the trust problem. 
		- Direct the Rider
		- Motivate the Elephant
		- Shape the Path


## Problems
- Management is directing the messaging to the Rider because they are assuming everyone is motivated (they don't recognize that a change is occurring)
- Management is assuming that key company leaders are evangelizing return to office
	- Senior people like working from home and plan to continue

## Ideas
- Rebuild company trust via events and meet ups - this could help us return to the office.
	- Copy Egwene from [[The Wheel of Time]].
	- What could we do to make the office exciting to open back up?
		- Why don't people want to do things with other people from the office?
- Get people back in the office to help them remember what it was like to sit with people in the office
	- Let's not make the decision now when we don't remember what it's like. 
- Find the feeling
	- Why is management so passionate about this?
	- Why are some people hesitant to do so?
	- What senior people are excited about returning to the office?
		- Jesse would quit his job if they went remote forever. 
			- Why? 
				- Because he always says the hardest problems are the people problems and people problems are always harder when you don't have deep relationships to build on. If you don't have it, it's harder to do and there is much less motivation to bother. If you aren't connected to people on a personal level atomic becomes less sticky and we lose expertise and we lose the brain trust. 
					- When trust goes down, monitoring and red tape go up. 
						- As an accelerator manager, that sucks and we start to move towards any other corporation.
					- When you are done pairing, the Zoom call ends. 
					- The Path of remote is not good at creating trust. 
				- [[03062021 - Levers]] - trust is a function of proximity. 
	- Can we convince people that this is critical for Atomic's survival?
		- Atomic is not a company of free agents. Atomic is a place where relationships are a first class citizen. 
			- Relationships matter.

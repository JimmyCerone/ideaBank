Based on my reading of [[Principles by Ray Dalio]], I think we could improve our diversification. We have diversification in that we have projects in many uncorrelated industries, but we still only have 1 revenue stream, which is our people. What if we could teach our philosophy to other companies through books and programs? What if we could codify our internal knowledge and sell that? Could we speculate about the industry? 

I think another improvement that I could actually make is creating a knowledge repository, similar to this, for future accelerators. 

#Estimation - can we create a map of projects based on tags that allows us to quickly triangulate an estimate?

#Team 

Why don't we have a systematic, transparent approach for building and assigning teams? How hard would it be to tell folks why they are on a certain project? This could be optional, but could be helpful information. 

- How does this process work right now? How are decisions made? Where does the information come from? CDMs?
- How does our current process #Scale?


## Questions

- Have people pushed back against decisions made by management? Have their been changes?
- What have been major changes initiated by employees?
- How has the accelerator changed over time? 
- Who among non - leadership people has created and sustained change?
- What avenues and processes exist for employees to create change?
- Does feedback make a difference at different levels?
	- Where does feedback get heard? Where isn't it heard?
- How much agency do employees really have?

## Projects
- Slack plug in that automatically surfaces past knowledge in past discussions and blogs
- Annotate Spin blog and turn that into a graph for people to see
	- Especially look into series of blog posts about the sales process & how Atomic does projects
	- Organize this by person. Index every person's blogs and see where they connect. 
- Google form that crowd sources what tools people use at Atomic for a spin post
- Create an organization graph from the periodic table with LinkedIn profiles
	- https://www.kumu.io/?ref=producthunt
- Generate an obsidian graph from source code structure


## Frameworks
- Atomic is like a bunch of little #Startup  s all within one company
- #Ideas at Atomic are like little products on the #Market. Atomic doesn't do #Hierarchy, but if something works, people will adopt it. 


## Ideas
- Privately hosted #Twitter / #SocialNetwork
	- Slack is good for keeping things (an archive) but not good at surfacing important or interesting things like #Twitter
	- Slack app - use this here. 
- Write blog posts about dev channel

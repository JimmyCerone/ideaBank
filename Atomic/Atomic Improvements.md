Based on my reading of [[Principles by Ray Dalio]], I think we could improve our diversification. We have diversification in that we have projects in many uncorrelated industries, but we still only have 1 revenue stream, which is our people. What if we could teach our philosophy to other companies through books and programs? What if we could codify our internal knowledge and sell that? Could we speculate about the industry? 

I think another improvement that I could actually make is creating a knowledge repository, similar to this, for future accelerators.

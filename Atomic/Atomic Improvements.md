Based on my reading of [[Principles by Ray Dalio]], I think we could improve our diversification. We have diversification in that we have projects in many uncorrelated industries, but we still only have 1 revenue stream, which is our people. What if we could teach our philosophy to other companies through books and programs? What if we could codify our internal knowledge and sell that? Could we speculate about the industry? 

I think another improvement that I could actually make is creating a knowledge repository, similar to this, for future accelerators. 

#Estimation - can we create a map of projects based on tags that allows us to quickly triangulate an estimate?

#Team 

Why don't we have a systematic, transparent approach for building and assigning teams? How hard would it be to tell folks why they are on a certain project? This could be optional, but could be helpful information. 

- How does this process work right now? How are decisions made? Where does the information come from? CDMs?
- How does our current process #Scale?

## Slack
- Could use improvement on how we use [[Slack]] in light of [[202104200859 - Chat is a greedy form of communication]].
> An engineer at Stripe told me about their careful balance of email, forums, and Slack. They recognize that Slack is not suitable for meaningful conversations, so they automatically delete chat messages older than a few weeks to discourage relying on it for long-term archival. In retrospectives, team members often reflect on whether they chose the right medium (email, chat, or forum) for various conversations.


## Questions

- Have people pushed back against decisions made by management? Have their been changes?
- What have been major changes initiated by employees?
- How has the accelerator changed over time? 
- Who among non - leadership people has created and sustained change?
- What avenues and processes exist for employees to create change?
- Does feedback make a difference at different levels?
	- Where does feedback get heard? Where isn't it heard?
- How much agency do employees really have?

## Projects
- Slack plug in that automatically surfaces past knowledge in past discussions and blogs
- Change the break culture at Atomic using principles from [[The Power of Habits by Charles Duhigg]] and [[Switch - How to Change Things When Change is Hard by Dan and Chip Heath]]
- Annotate Spin blog and turn that into a graph for people to see
	- Especially look into series of blog posts about the sales process & how Atomic does projects
	- Think about modeling Atomic after Starbucks, whose training program is so rigorous it can be counted for college credits. 
	- Organize this by person. Index every person's blogs and see where they connect. 
- Google form that crowd sources what tools people use at Atomic for a spin post
- Create an organization graph from the periodic table with LinkedIn profiles
	- https://www.kumu.io/?ref=producthunt
- Generate an obsidian graph from source code structure


## Frameworks
- Atomic is like a bunch of little #Startup  s all within one company
- #Ideas at Atomic are like little products on the #Market. Atomic doesn't do #Hierarchy, but if something works, people will adopt it. 


## Ideas
- Privately hosted #Twitter / #SocialNetwork
	- Slack is good for keeping things (an archive) but not good at surfacing important or interesting things like #Twitter
	- Slack app - use this here. 
- Write blog posts about dev channel
- Atomic Comic Book
	- Should have a new edition every year for Atomicon
- Atomic Writing Workshop
	- Bird by Bird by Anne Lammot
- An advancement system based on individualization instead of categorization. 
	- Could be modeled off of what was presented in [[Principles by Ray Dalio]]. 


## Questions
- What if the value of the Atomic braintrust is external? At first I was so focused on capturing the value internally, but what if it is a subset of the teach and learn philosophy? 
	- The conversation I had with Jonah Bailey sparked this: ![[Screen Shot 2021-04-16 at 5.29.36 PM.png]]
- How can we make people at atomic to feel enough to change from [[Switch - How to Change Things When Change is Hard by Dan and Chip Heath]] & [[The Power of Habits by Charles Duhigg]]?:
	- blogging
	- Staying collocated
		- Problem:
			- Shawn and Mike don't see this as a change. 
			- Basically we have this problem [[202105051416 - Aiming at the Rider gives direction but not motivation]] because they think people already have motivation. 
				- People are experiencing this as a loss, not a gain.
				- "We just want to get back to where we were then we can experiment" is being interpreted as, "Give up all your leverage and then we will talk about"
				- Why does leadership feel so strongly about this?
					- Consistent problem where leadership feels like they are being super thoughtful and therefore deserve trust. 
						- The problem is that since we haven't been colocated trust has decayed. 
							- Therefore, we need to fix the trust problem. 
		- Direct the Rider
		- Motivate the Elephant
		- Shape the Path
	- Taking breaks 
	- Ideas:
		- Live music
		- Dad to dj 
		- Bring the bar to atomic
		- Do education better than anyone else
		- Provide childcare
		- Themed events that are consistent 
		- Dog park

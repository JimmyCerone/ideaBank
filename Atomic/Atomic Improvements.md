Based on my reading of [[Principles by Ray Dalio]], I think we could improve our diversification. We have diversification in that we have projects in many uncorrelated industries, but we still only have 1 revenue stream, which is our people. What if we could teach our philosophy to other companies through books and programs? What if we could codify our internal knowledge and sell that? Could we speculate about the industry? 

I think another improvement that I could actually make is creating a knowledge repository, similar to this, for future accelerators. 

#Estimation - can we create a map of projects based on tags that allows us to quickly triangulate an estimate?

#Team 

Why don't we have a systematic, transparent approach for building and assigning teams? How hard would it be to tell folks why they are on a certain project? This could be optional, but could be helpful information. 

- How does this process work right now? How are decisions made? Where does the information come from? CDMs?
- How does our current process #Scale?


## Questions

- Have people pushed back against decisions made by management? Have their been changes?
- What have been major changes initiated by employees?
- How has the acclerator changed over time? 
- Who among non - leadership people has created and sustained change?
- What avenues and processes exist for employees to create change?
- Does feedback make a difference at different levels?
	- Where does feedback get heard? Where isn't it heard?
- How much agency do employees really have?

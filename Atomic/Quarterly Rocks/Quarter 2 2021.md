NEW VERSION
## Make Spin Easy Again

Expected delivery date: 2021-07-01

## What value would you like to focus on building for yourself this quarter?

I would like to make Spin easier for the whole company. 

## Host Spin Brainstorming Session (99% confidence)

Schedule VPLs with people who are struggling to come up with Spin ideas to generate the questions for the dumb Slack chat bot. 

### What Does Success Look Like

-   Setup 5 VPLs with people to brainstorm Spin ideas. 
    

### Risks and Challenges

-   There won’t be 5 interested people
    
-   I will run low on hours
    

## Build dumb Slack chat bot (66% confidence)

Imitate K-probes in that it just asks you a bunch of questions to help you generate ideas. Base the questions on what worked in the Spin Brainstorming Sessions.

### What Does Success Look Like

-   Build basic slack app that asks a series of questions to generate ideas
    

-   Store these ideas somewhere as people respond to create repo of ideas
    

-   Meet with 3 more people to see how the Chat bot is doing
    

### Risks and Challenges

-   I’ve never built a Slack app before
    
-   What language should I use?
    

-   HTTP API that will invoke my server
    
-   Jesse used Sinatra app in Ruby
    

-   How should I host this?
    

-   Railway? AWS? Heroku? 
    
-   Stephen hosted it for him.
    

-   Getting permission from Micah and Steven to put this on Atomic’s slack
    
-   How can I test this out before I try to convince people? 
    

-   Create my own slack team
    
-   Jesse hosted his on his machine and setup slack to point at a public URL (util does this). 
    

  

## Build smart Slack chat bot (33% confidence)

1.  Analyze dev channel to surface ideas that people are already talking about
    

1.  Build word clouds
    
2.  Check thread count
    
3.  Messages / unit time
    

3.  Use NLP to check out Spin posts and generate ideas based on what was popular in the past. 
    

1.  Create a list of subject matter experts for the Wiki / Punch It project
    

  

### What Does Success Look Like

-   Whereas the first edition just asked questions, this one actively gives out ideas.
    

### Risks and Challenges

-   Gaining access to Spin posts
    

-   Web crawler
    
-   Wordpress Export
    

-   Dashboard, API?
    

-   Lack of time
    
-   Synchronous vs. Asynchronous
    

-   Do I run this once, manually? Do I try to keep up with Spin? 
    

-   Parsing data from Slack
    
-   Censoring bad ideas

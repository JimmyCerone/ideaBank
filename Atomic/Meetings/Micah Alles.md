## DISC Reflection 02-19-2021

Took the DISC Assessment 10 years ago. Was still working mostly on projects. Has only been in his current role in 2013. He was probably leading teams and projects. Pre DL and was acting as project lead, which was like a combo of TL and DL. 

He facilitated and made user experience decisions. Whenever he was on a project, he was basically taking on the design lead, delivery lead, and technical lead all rolled into one. 

The people who were put into that position would push back on the office scheduling team saying they can't program and pair and mentor on top of everything else. 

5 - 10 years prior he was just a developer on projects. None of the extra responsibility. Work was rules based, task based. You got a story, you wrote tests, you programmed what needed to be done. It was rote work, with a little problem solving thrown in. 

The high C came from the developer role, where you had to nail down requirements. Then when he was put in the team leadership role, he had to adapt to the role and lower his compliance. Compliance doesn't help in that role nor the role he is in now. There are no rules to follow. He is independently planning everything he is doing. There is no backlog, he has to build it. It's a much more open ended set of responsibilities. 

The upgrade in communication is likely where the influencer skills come into play. Most of the work was getting people aligned and feeling good about the work.

Doesn't feel comfortable defining the rules. Would rather get personal alignment first, then go in a direction. 

## Reflections
- DISC is good for comparison, strengths finder is better for self-awareness



## Question
- Does the rating equate to competency?
- Would you say you learned new skills and are now comfortable with your adapted set?
	- Yes. Both the natural and adapted could look closer to the adapted style from before. The work he does now is building compliance for the company. 
- You have the highest dominance in the company, do you identify with that?
	- Remembers reading this summary and thinking I hope I never have to meet this asshole. First read he felt frustrated because he didn't identify with it. Then he was anxious because he was afraid he might have been this person.
	- He was never someone to push his ideas on others, favors a cooperative environment over a top down one. His actions never bore out in a way that a high dominance can be interpreted. He wouldn't try to lead every meeting and spearhead every conversation. 
	- Does recognize that he has very strong points of view and has high standards for everyone he works with. At first, he was holding them to these standards and wasn't communicating them well. 
	- If he tries to hold people to the internal standard, it's impossible to meet because he doesn't have enough information, plus there are different ways to success. 
	- Using different frameworks outside of DISC are helpful. 
	- Glosses over unconscious biases that people may have. 
- Could we have people at Atomic retake this exam? 
- How can we use these tools to figure out how to work well with others, like [[Principles by Ray Dalio]]?

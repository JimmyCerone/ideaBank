## Intro
- My rock is to get involved with the startup community and my BHAG is to judge a startup competition. 

## Questions
- Who are the best organizations in town? 
	- Start Garden is probably the most active.
	- CEI
		- Sharoque Runs this at Grand Valley University
	- What is the best way to plug in with each of them?
		- Lots of connections on the funding side.
- What's your involvement with the startup communities in the area?
- How did you get involved? How have others done it successfully?
- What is your 100 year vision for [[Atomic Object]]?
	- Considered this question in 2017 and 2018. 
		- Distinction between commercial purpose and true purpose.
			- Alcoa 
				- Commerical make steel
				- True be safe
			- Atomic
				- Commercial = Make great custom software
					- Likely to be disrupted and doesn't include the whole company. Boils down to "be the best"
				- True Purpose = Source & Force
					- [[The Infinite Game by Simon Sinek]] inspired this.
						- Leaves space to have goals within this (destination from [[Switch - How to Change Things When Change is Hard by Dan and Chip Heath]]). 
							- Current goal is to have 5-10 offices in the next X years. 
								- Two ways to accomplish this:
									- Figure out how many locations can support Atomic without being too big
										- Indianapolis and Cincinnatti but not NY
										- Between GR size and 2 million people
										- Not that many. 
										- Goal is to have 50% of the work coming from local market
									- Ask Atoms who are interested in moving where they want to move
										- Work from filtered down list to see who is interested in Atomic's services. j
									- Build national brand then dive down to smaller markets
										- Only a few thousand people interested in a book that Atomic would publish because it would hit folks with 5-7 years of experience
										- You could use GNB as a bouncing off point
					- Source means:
						- We want people to be respected for who they are, have friends, feel welcome.
					- Force means: 
						- Engage with the community. 
- What do you think about the Atomic brain? 
	- Bring up [[Obsidian]] and networked thought. 
	- Our business model is renting access to the Atomic Braintrust for a set period of time
	- Very hard to figure out how to do this efficiently
		- Sharing ideas is hard and we use:
			- Slack
			- Spin
			- Get together
			- Punch It
				- If you annotated a project with what technologies were involved you could determine who was a subject matter expert. 
					- Include libraries
						- Could identify security vulnerabilities
				- Could be used for the company to guide professional development
					- Help people develop a niche
					- Self organizing because people can just do that.
				- Could be used to help with marketing
	- Knowledge Management Problem
		- Tried to use a Wiki
			- Gives you nice ability to use hyperlink connections and requires that people are committed to taking the time to maintain it. 
				- Work like this is important but not urgent and it's unclear how it helps the company

# Programming Languages
Choice of language is part technical and part cultural. 

## Typing

### Clojure
- Environment is dynamic meaning you can inspect and modify a running program. You can connect your editor to a running clojure instance and start replacing functions on the fly.

### Typescript
- Opposite trade off from Clojure. In typescript, the compiler analyzes your code, checks that it's correct and outputs compiled code. You can't change it without recompiling.

Retook his DISC assessment (TTI is like DISC+)

According to Daryl, Chris chilled out a little bit. 

D 77 -> 37

- Why? 
	- Also took the Strengths Finder and one of his top strengths is adaptability. As he considered that, he views lots of things as arbitrary and is willing to reinvent himself if it's helpful. Growing up, high D served him better in a less cooperative environment. Coming to #AtomicObject , where he was surrounded by other capable people, he didn't need to be as high D anymore. 

- When do people take TTI and other tests? 
	- When roles change and/or during application process for internal roles. 


Historically, Atomic had many more high D because it was a smaller company with high risk.

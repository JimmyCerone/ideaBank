Reasoning: I am confused by this story and could use clarification. I'm confused whether this is a backend change, or a domain change. I'm also confused as to whether this will impact the import. It looks like it's the structuring of an import.

Reasoning: This seems like a simple button drop in connected to a query that already exists. My sense is that there could be some wrinkles in the loading state, but that's it.

Reasoning: While I think this could be complicated, I think there could be a simple fix for this. If not, I'm thinking it's gonna be tough. To account for this risk, I'll give it an 8. Upon consideration, I think since it is a bug, it's probably a 5 max.

My Rating: 8 
Team Rating: 8
Difference: 0

Reasoning: There seems to be complicated logic that would require lots of testing plus potential query changes. 

https://jira.amway.com:8443/browse/FUS-1739

Questions: Is this happening already? Why do we have this story?

Reasoning: If this isn't happening already, it's a focused fix. Small query / mutation change should do it.

Reasoning: This seems like a simple linking problem with a little bit of a UI update. I think the hard part will be coordinating stuff from one page to another and testing will be tough.

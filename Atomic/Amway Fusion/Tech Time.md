- [x] Memory Issue Fix
	- Building the server is what runs out of memory
	- `server.config.js`
		- `scriptentry`
		- `lambdaentry`
		- Build all scripts
	- Problem probably lies with the shared scripts
	- when doing a `yarn build` we don't have to build every single script
		- split scripts directory into two camps
			1. Essential scripts
				- `post-migrate` is essential
			2. Useful scripts (db-setup stuff)
				- These are in a separate command called `yarn build scripts`

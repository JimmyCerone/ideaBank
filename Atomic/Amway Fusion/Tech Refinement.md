Reasoning: I think Jordan and I are doing this already as part of our story. That said, I don't think this will be insane. Meredith brought up that we are using a fragment right now that could be updated to make it easier to trigger a refresh.

Reasoning: Seems like a simple update of a component. The read only prop is preexisting and there are also precedents.

Reasoning: Timing issues scare me because they often require loooots of work. At least in my experience they did. Then on top of that timing work there is a new function to write and test.

Reasoning: This feels like it is mostly adapting existing components. It's likely there are a few wrinkles, but it seems like work we've done before and relatively straightforward. Jason bumped this up to a 5 because of the need for good tests.

Reasoning: I am confused by this story and could use clarification. I'm confused whether this is a backend change, or a domain change. I'm also confused as to whether this will impact the import. It looks like it's the structuring of an import.

Reasoning: This seems like a simple button drop in connected to a query that already exists. My sense is that there could be some wrinkles in the loading state, but that's it.

Reasoning: While I think this could be complicated, I think there could be a simple fix for this. If not, I'm thinking it's gonna be tough. To account for this risk, I'll give it an 8. Upon consideration, I think since it is a bug, it's probably a 5 max.

Reasoning: Feels like an isolated bug, which I like. I think for that reason, I'm giving it a 3 since there shouldn't be much testing or unintended consequences.

My Rating: 8 
Team Rating: 8
Difference: 0

Reasoning: There seems to be complicated logic that would require lots of testing plus potential query changes. 

https://jira.amway.com:8443/browse/FUS-1739

Questions: Is this happening already? Why do we have this story?

My Rating: 3
Team Rating: 3
Difference: 0

Reasoning: If this isn't happening already, it's a focused fix. Small query / mutation change should do it.

https://jira.amway.com:8443/browse/FUS-1740

Questions: Is BV editable? Are we doing this already?

Reasoning: I think this is a 5 because there are going to be snags as this is a very detail oriented story.

Reasoning: This feels like a caching issue and in my experience that can be hard to pinpoint and test.

Reasoning: This seems like a simple linking problem with a little bit of a UI update. I think the hard part will be coordinating stuff from one page to another and testing will be tough.

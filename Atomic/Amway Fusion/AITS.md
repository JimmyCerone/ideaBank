## Expectations
- Meetings every Monday morning
	- Team sync and questions - open the code to talk about things to give a good reference
	- Give them a pairing experience
- Review PRs 
	- Goal is to have 2 reviews
	- Take a longer time than normal & call out more than you might think and write more than you might guess
	- More feedback normally comes with GraphQL API and the backend in general
	- Depending on the PR if both Nick and I look at it and it's a PR that we both feel comfortable with it then it's ok to send it through. 
	- I'll take the first pass at the PR
		- Entails looking at the review environment and looking at the code
	- How do you check the PRs?
		- They will message me if I don't see it right away
		- When I have free time, I can check for their PRs by searching for author and isOpen

## General Notes

- Weekly morning meetings are kind of like a touch base and kind of like a work session
- PR reviews are in depth and include links to existing documentation

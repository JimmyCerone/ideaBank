- Similarities
	- Deep work with breaks in between to  be able to focus
		- Rhythm of intense and relaxed
		- One person is focused on the last thing and the other has already moved on to the last thing
			- Clearly communicating what we are thinking on / when we are ready to move on. 
				- Clearly communicate where my mind is. 
- Look more into [[Terraform]]
- Taken stories he thought he could do and worked on them late at night so that he was forced to work without asking questions 

## [[2021-06-09]]

- Social life while pairing
	- Bringing in random things disturbs context
		- Maybe consider building out a system to take note of things you might want to say
		- Extra important with Prod Support because there are lots of splits on focus.
	- Reminds me of what I found last night about the urgency levels
		- How do we bring this in person?
			- Generally in person there is one channel (like [[It's hard to connect with people on large video calls]]) which makes it hard to create levels of urgency
	- #Privacy 
		- Split out messaging communication to the phone so that's private
		- Benefit is that it keeps you accountable
	- Communicate when you aren't actively pairing
		- Tell them what other thing is going on.
	- How to manage extra thoughts and being unfocused
		- If your brain is worried about what is going on outside of work you need a way to let go of them. They just won't go away. It takes processing power to try to keep a hold of that idea. 
		- Jot down a quick note to explore after work
		- It's easier to get distracted when things are boring
	- For the upcoming sprint, start thinking through what is the next step?
		- Instead of thinking about something else, think about the next step. Or take notes on what you have been doing and what is coming next
		- Use this as a filter when considering the next thing to do. 
	- [[202106091124 - Pomodoro Technique]]
		- Hard to apply here, needs to be more flexible. 
		- So maybe what I can learn here is that planned breaks are useful
	- When was I in the groove?
		- Monday I had setup the test and had the DB and was debugging directly with #SQL. [[Lydia Cupery]] was excited by this because it was good debugging! And I was using the tools directly. 

## [[2021-05-26]]

- Why was this sprint so much better? 
	- Mechanical improvements made the pairing experience better for [[Jordan Nelson]]
	- Increased focus ([[03062021 - Levers]])
		- Using camo for video
		- Being focused for the first day seems to be huge
			- This helps me understand the big picture which keeps me engaged
			- Kind of an 80/20 thing
		- More drive time
	- Learning
		- Learn more during work instead of trying to create time outside of work
			- Look at how you can make your day better tomorrow instead of trying to follow industry trends
		- Learn low hanging fruit for day to day
			- VIM

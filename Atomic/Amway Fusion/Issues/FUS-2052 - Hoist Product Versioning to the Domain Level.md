## Goal
- Enable us to display the stable (non-versioned) aspects of Products that are not yet effective, presumably so we can avoid conflicts for not yet effective products.
- Further, adapt the way we handle deletion so that it no longer relies on simply changing the effective date, which will no longer work given the above implementation.

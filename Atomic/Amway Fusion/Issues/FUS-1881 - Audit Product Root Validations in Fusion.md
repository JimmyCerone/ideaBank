## TODO 
- [ ] Go through the app and figure out where SKU parsing is happening
	- [ ] Find where we are using SKU stuff
- [x] Schedule meeting for tomorrow meeting with Jason about SKU rules

## Hypothesis
- Three parts:
	- Existing Data
		- Once we know what the rules are, we can do SQL stuff to check if the rules are adhering to the rules. 
	- Created data
		- Here we just check everywhere there is a new SKU root created and see if the rules are correct. 
	- Edit Data
		- Edit product page


## Questions
- How do we even find all these places? 
- What is the way to identify where we are processing sku roots?

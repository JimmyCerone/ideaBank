#Problem: Sprint demos are time consuming to setup because they require rapid acquisition of context. 

#### Questions
- What if each developer created a demo packet that makes it easy for the next person to demo? What if this were collected just pre demo?
- Would templates be helpful?
- The time consuming part is more figuring out what you should talk about. What's most important? Can we highlight this at the start?

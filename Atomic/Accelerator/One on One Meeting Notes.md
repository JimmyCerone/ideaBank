## Action Items
- Tackle topics in isolation
	- Work through #Books one by one instead of trying to take on a whole system like building a #React app from scratch with a #Backend
- Block out chunks of time instead of trying to do things #Daily
- Make coding an adventure
	- Write about what you learn every day (makes it motivating to look back on)
	- Find 1 way to be helpful every day
- Compare to your past self - what did you improve? Instead of comparing to others
- For my [[Atomic Improvements]], ask is information organization a #Problem?

## Questions

- How do you determine where to skill up a designer since it's so big of a field? 
	- Most of the team is less worried about tools. Generally they are easy to skill up on (though Adobe can be tough). Much easier to learn than learning a new language. Leveling up talks about the big chunky topics like user research and prototyping. Go after a topic, looks for books conferences, etc. Topical learning. 
- Where is the "line" where things are out of your hands?
	- Sometimes the lines don't get drawn. Almost all the designers have also been DL's or are DL's now. Think Taylor now. Designers are most often setting up the structure of the engagement up front. They are driving everyone through a set of activities to figure out goals and problems. The design team will be ready to take charge of the up front of the project to get what they need. Close communication with the TL and DL. There are shared responsibilities, just as Devs sometimes to #Design, design folks sometimes have to program.
	- Do user personas have systems for evaluating personas?

## Reflections
- Hopes & Fears activity is fascinating and sounds super useful...
	- You run it at the start and end of the process
- Defining Roles is another activity that can help avoid #Politics and the landmines that comes with in the office
- #Design is a process. That's a big deal. I didn't know that there was a process to all this and as a process, it seems less intimidating to learn. I think [[Neil]] and I should start practicing this.


## General Notes
- User personas help you understand who you are building for. 
	- When the user isn't present, you are guessing and making a proto persona. Nothing should ever be built from a proto persona. Assumptions must be validated.

## Problem
- Information doesn't move up the company efficiently (see [[RTO Plan]] problems)

## Solution

- Could be integrated into the CDM role to synthesize into information for MPs

- [[03062021 - Levers]] for information moving up the chain
	- Company isn't all collocated even in the best of times
	- Info gets stuck with peers or CDMs
	- Seems to work at the advisory board level
- Connects with the ideas channel 
- Scheduled google form that people can add questions to


## Questions
- Does this need to be anonymous? Could it be partly anonymous?
- How do other companies do this?

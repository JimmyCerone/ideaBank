Ideas:

I need to somehow constrain this list so I’m not writing like crazy, or I need to make it really easy to come up with each thing (like a MEME).

What is the purpose of this article? Probably mostly to m ake developers laugh. 

It’s funny to hear developers talk about programming languages because they speak almost as if they have souls of their own. Yet when it comes time to explain these souls to outsiders, the languages clam up, holding tightly to their secrets. 

When I attempt to explain programming languages to those who don’t live with them, my words come out half formed and full of jargon. “Dynamically typed,” I sputter. “Compiled,” I say with a shrug. “Functional,” I wince. 

To try to make the explanation easier, I started wondering I could to anthropomorphize these programming languages the way we do our dogs and cars. What if instead of saying Typescript was a, “Dynamically typed compiled language,” I could say it was like the perfectionist of programming? 

As I thought about this idea more and more, I found I liked it. So, without further ado, here is the anthropomorphization of the programming languages I know. 

Python

Python is the smart, yet lazy kid you hated in high school. Python takes a million shortcuts, waits till the last second to do things, and still manages to look like a genius. 

Javascript

Javascript is Typescript’s older brother, but acts like the younger. Like Python, Javascript is lazy, but doesn’t look quite as smart. Javascript is more of the handy type, doing a little of everything and getting the job done, though probably not as quickly as possible. 

C

C is like a wily old person who works in weird yet effective ways. C is the person who knows all the tricks to get the machine working fast, though it’s always done with duck tape and paper clips. 

C++

C++ is the younger version of C with all the confidence but none of the same comfort with its tools. While C works in unorthodox ways, those ways are solid and tested. C++ is more free wheeling, trying to do new things with old tools. 

Clojure

Clojure is the cryptocurrency of 5 years ago. It was big for a while, but chose the wrong horse to bet on: Java.

Java

Java is an odd bird. A “good” enough type of language that is precise and traditional, unwilling to adapt to new ways yet still around because it does the old things well. 

Prolog

Prolog is like the weird cousin you invite to your wedding because you have. Once invited, Prolog doesn’t do much other than make weird jokes and laugh quietly. 

Standard ML

Standard ML is the professor of the tribe, haughty yet for good reason. The only “purely” mathematically complete language, Standard ML is rarely used but spoken of in hushed tones. 

Racket

Racket is like a robot maker. Racket is mostly used to write other programming languages and is handy, yet not particularly noteworthy in and of itself.

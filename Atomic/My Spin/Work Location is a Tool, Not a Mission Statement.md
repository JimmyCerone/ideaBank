All over the news, we are hearing about the growing divide between those in the "Remote Work" and "In Person" camps. This divide is cutting across companies, people, and industries.

And if I'm honest, this whole divide is stupid and artificial.

It's inane to imagine that remote or in person is the real issue here.

You can have a terrible remote company and a terrible in person company.

Being in person or remote is only one of many factors that make a company work. By dumbing down this debate to in person or remote, we lose the purpose behind in person or remote.

Because in the end, your location is a tool and one of many. An important tool, but simply a tool nonetheless.

The usefulness of tools is ultimately determined by their purpose, what they are used for.

Die casts are useful, but if I make haphazard plastic lumps with a die cast, the tool is going to look dumb.

What I'm proposing here is looking past remote versus in person to values and purpose.

At Atomic Object, we make custom software in teams. Our special sauce is collaboration.

Whether we are in person or remote, our goal is to collaborate effectively.

Notice how shifting our focus to collaboration, one of our core values, shifts our priorities. What types of questions are we asking now?

They aren't about how many or how few days we should go into the office.

Instead, they are about what tools we can use to better collaborate in all situations. What processes we need to stay collaborative. What type of culture encourages collaboration.

Thankfully, remote and in person considerations play big into these questions, but they aren't the end all be all of the questions.

In my last #Spin post, [[Coding as Building]], I broke down the mystery of #Coding with a construction metaphor that made the mysterious tools of the trade concrete. After I wrote that post, I realized that while I'd made the tools of the trade concrete, I'd failed to make them specific. 

To fix this oversight, I sent out a Google form to Atomic Object asking about the 4 tools of the trade I broke down in my last article: 
1. Text Editors / IDEs (A Developers Hammer & Nails)
2. Terminals (The Builder - think Bob)
3. Languages (The Building Codes of the Software World)
4. Cloud (Subcontractors)

The rest of the article is a breakdown of the results to make the concrete tools of the trade specific. 

## Text Editors 
As I said before, the text editor is like the hammer & nails of the software world. Most everyone uses a text editor day to day, be it Word or Google Docs. In the last article, I said that Software Developers use fancy text editors called Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). Today, we will look at the one's most commonly used at #AtomicObject. 

Based on a small sample of Atomic developers, the most common text editors at Atomic are: 

1. #VSCode
2. Intellij 
3. Atom
4. Vim
5. Emacs

### VSCode
VS Code is dominant in the text editor space. Why? Here's what Atomic developers said: 
> I used Atom before VS Code. VS Code felt a lot like Atom but more stable and fast and included a built in terminal which was the primary reason I switched over.
> Ability to connect to edit code inside a running docker container, excellent TypeScript support
> Drew told me to. Just kidding (sort of). I was using Atom before AO, and very quickly switched to VS Code because it seemed fairly standard at AO, and like it had a lot of great functionality. I had also used VS in classes, too, so there were certain things that felt fairly familiar.
> emacs has some incredible tools, like magit and structural editing. vscode is great too.
> Modern OSX app, good extensions, good vim extension.
> Works well with TypeScript, lots of plugins available

#### First Text Editors
1. Sublime
2. Eclipse
3. Pico
4. Vim

- BlueJ
- Atom
- MSDOS Edit.com
- Notepad++
- QBasic
- Text Wrangler

#### Notes
- Lots of this is project specific and dependent on the language. IntelliJ for Java, VS Code for Typescript. 

#### Comments


##### IntelliJ
- Lots of good language/platform support, especially for JVM languages

## Terminal
1. iTerm
2. Default
3. ohmyzsh

#### Comments

##### iTerm
- iTerm for its theming ability.
- At one point, someone said I should use iTerm instead of the default OSX Terminal.app and I haven't looked back.
- Because it was better than Terminal in 2010.
- Good tabbing and pane splitting
- I don't remember. Maybe I should try Terminal.app again.
- Way more powerful than built in terminal, and have never had a need to look at any other options
##### Default
- Don't use/need any features beyond what is needed
- Apple terminal is nice. I've never found myself wanting iterm features.

##### Ohmyzsh
- works for my uses & first one I've tried . Have still to experiment

## Language
1. Typescript
2. Ruby

- F#
- Python
- Clojure

#### First Language
Basic I
C++ I
C 2
Java 5
HTML 2
QuakeC 1
Javascript 2
Python 1
QBasic 1
Ruby 1
TI Basic 1
Visual Basic 1
Microsoft Assembler 1


##### Typescript
- Flexibility of JavaScript paired with strong and expressive typing.
- Can run in browser and server side, static types are great for unfamiliar code bases, functions are first class objects, lots of automated testing options, incorporates a lot of functional programming concepts.
- It's been really fun to learn! It's forced me think about certain technical decisions and how to model parts of a project's architecture in different (and powerful) ways when working on features that I probably wouldn't have approached in the same way if we didn't enforce type safety (which has saved us from future headaches). I also like that I can usually drill into types and fairly quickly gain knowledge about how certain parts of the architecture are related.

##### Ruby
- It's minimal, easy to read, lots of open source libraries, and has awesome meta-programming capabilities.
- Ruby is a great language for scripting and general purpose programming tasks. It's my default option if I want to write a quick script and I often enjoy programming in Ruby more than other languages. With that being said, there are many things I despise about it. I don't find it to be a great option when working with a team, but for solo development it's great.

##### F#
- it's concise, expressive, and easier to write correct code

##### Python
- simple, abstracts a lot, less worried about memory issues

##### Clojure
- highly interactive, strong tools for metaprogramming and DSL building

##### Other
- I like to use whatever is the best fit for what I'm trying to accomplish. Sometimes that's C, and sometimes it's TypeScript, and sometimes it's PHP. It just depends.


## Cloud Platform
1. AWS
2. Heroku

- Google Cloud
- Azure
- Vultr

##### AWS 
- It's what my current client preferred. 
- It's what has been used on recent projects I've worked on. 
- It's a great bang for your buck.

##### Heroku
- Ease of deployment
- Because it's a wonderful abstraction on top of AWS that makes it so I don't have to think about the underlying resource architecture.
- 

##### Vultr
- I can run OpenBSD on it out of the box

##### Google Cloud
- i use all but google cloud had some tools related to translation that I needed that I wasnt immediately sure that other cloud services provided

##### Azure
- Current client uses Azure

# Version 2

There is something about doing that makes learning stick.

  

The way I see it, our brains are like giant sticky webs, capturing knowledge to snack on later.

  

You can fill this web in one of 3 ways:

1\. Spaced repetition (aka School) 2. Integrating knowledge into an existing web (aka Obsidian & Roam) 3. Making a new web via "doing".

  

Each of these approaches have their merits. The first approach works for knowledge unrelated to what you already know. As an added bonus, it gives you quick recall of said knowledge.

  

So if you are an English speaker trying to learn Spanish, space repetition works like a charm. It helps you learn a language unrelated to the one you already know and keeps what you learn close at hand.

  

Approach 2 is wonderful if the new knowledge relates to things you already know. With this method, you leverage what you already know to learn what you don't yet. A powerful lever, but not one that works in every situation.

  

Approach 3 covers a different kind of learning, one which is tactile and experiential. You can't use Quizlet to become a master fencer nor can you use Obsidian to learn to dunk a basketball. Some knowledge is tactile, only learned via doing.

  

Most of coding falls into this 3rd category. You can memorize an API with spaced repetition. You can learn the basics of functional programming by leveraging your knowledge of Object Oriented programming. But, building an application from scratch is a whole different animal.

  

There are trade offs to consider and personalities to manage. There are security vulnerabilities and performance considerations. And always, always, there are bugs.

  

So how does one do this tactile learning that coding seems to demand?

  

In my time at Atomic Object, where you learn on the job, I've found 3 things have worked:

  

1\. KISS 2. Make it your own 3. Make it communal

  

## 

1\. KISS

Keep it stupid simple. Whenever I fail a project, I see an over-complicated mess in my rear-view mirror.

  

My most memorable failure was Before I joined Atomic Object. I was a naive high school kid fed up with the boring training of Pokemon. To skip to the fun parts of the game, I created an automated Pokemon player to do my dirty work. The first iteration was stupid simple. I used hot glue, screws, wood, and servos to button mash my way to victory.

  

My second iteration was anything but simple and in the end, quite stupid. For my second iteration, I tried to build a Machine Learning powered Computer Vision Raspberry Pi. When it was all said and done, I'd fried my SD Card, failed to even download the Computer Vision package, and given up.

  

Reflecting back on the experience, I realize I went 0 to 100.

  

I went from technology I knew solving a problem that was challenging to technology I didn't know solving a problem that was insane.

  

Don't be second iteration me.

  

Be first iteration me.

  

Keep it stupid simple by learning one thing at a time.

  

Think of your learning like an experiment. In the best science experiments, they change one variable at a time.

  

Start simple and keep it simple by adding one new thing to learn each iteration.

  

## 

Make It Your Own

  

Last quarter, our Accelerator cohort decided to study Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS, if nothing else, prides itself on details and weird names, two things I'm terrible at.

  

I knew if I was going to learn anything about AWS, I was going to need a trick. Thanks to Joe Chrysler, I found one.

  

Joe created an imaginary world in which Atomic Object needed AWS to help manage our interplanetary shipping system.

  

Now I was no longer learning random AWS names, I was building the future of Atomic Object. Not only did the shipping system focus our learning, it gave us a sense of ownership.

  

Crafting a project to address your stupid simple learning goal gets your emotions involved.

  

As everyone knows, we care more about things we own (at least most of the time).

  

For learning the basics, boilerplate tutorials work well, but to make things stick, we have to take things to the next emotional level.

  

We have to make the project our own, either by relating it to where we work, like Joe did, or by bringing the project home, like my coworker Lauren did. Lauren is making her fridge smart with a Raspberry Pi.

  

The project you choose can be anything. The only thing they need to be is your own.

  

\----

  

Boilerplate starter kits like this one for Ruby on Rails are great for getting your momentum (they give you a small win) but can only take you so far.

  

To dive deep, you need to dig deep. And to dig deep, you need to get personal.

  

\## Make it Communal

  

There is a real misconception that programming is a lonely endeavor. I've talked about what people who aren't in tech think of us before (LINK), but I failed to mention this tidbit. Even with a whole book written to disprove it (\[\[The Innovator's - How a group of Hacker's, Geniuses and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution\]\]), the perception still exists that you can magically learn to become a coding wizard alone.

  

Learning along isn't impossible, but it is harder. When we group up, we leverage the power of weak social ties and the pressure they create to help us get work done.

  

By taking inspiration from the group, we lower the amount of will power (a limited quantity) we have to use to get shit done. Thus, we get more shit done!

  

Plus, having a community around us helps shape our thoughts. This works in two ways.

  

First, you have to share your thoughts, which initiates a process of refining and crafting them that you don't do alone.

  

Second, you receive feedback and different perspectives.

  

My first quarterly rock for this month, which was about connecting with the West Michigan Startup scene, was hopelessly abstract until my friend recommended finding a startup to invest in via Republic.

  

I never would have figured out how to make my goal concrete, but my coworker cracked the code that led me to reconsider my desire to learn investing (waaaay too many details).

  

\## Summary So. As you go forward to learn the next new tech stack or whatever, remember to KISS, make it your own, and keep it communal. Good luck!

# Version 1

There is something about doing that makes the learning stick. 

The way I see it, our brains are like giant sticky webs, capturing knowledge to be snacked on later. 

You can fill this web in one of 3 ways: 
1. Spaced repetition (aka School)
2. Integrating knowledge into an existing web (aka [[Obsidian]] & Roam)
3. Making a new web with related behaviors. 

Each of these approaches have their merits. Approach 1 is great for knowledge you need quick at hand that cannot be well integrated into existing memory. 

So if you are an English speaker trying to learn Spanish, [[041120211358 - Spaced Repetition]] works like a charm. 

Approach 2 is wonderful if the new knowledge is related to things you already know. With this method, you leverage what you already know to learn what you don't yet. A powerful [[03062021 - Levers]], but not one that works in every situation. 

Approach 3 covers a different kind of learning, one which is tactile. You can't use Quizlet to become a master fencer nor can you use [[Obsidian]] to learn to dunk a basketball. Some knowledge is tactile, only learned via doing. 

Most of coding falls into this 3rd category. You can memorize an API with [[041120211358 - Spaced Repetition]] and you can understand the basics of functional programming by integrating it into your web alongside Object Oriented programming, but building an application is much more than head knowledge. 

There are trade offs to consider and personalities to manage. There are security vulnerabilities and performance considerations. And always, always, there are bugs. 

So how do you make learning concrete?

In my time at [[Atomic Object]], where you learn on the job, I've found 3 things have worked:

1. KISS
2. Make it your own
3. Make it communal

## KISS
Keep it stupid simple. Whenever I fail a project, I inevitably look back to see an over complicated mess. Back before I joined [[Atomic Object]], I worked on an automated Pokemon player to avoid the mind numbing training of the game because why should a video game be hard? After starting off smart and keeping it simple in my first iteration of the project, I tried to jump into Raspberry Pi and Computer Vision and Machine Learning and Python all at the same time. Needless to say, it was a colossal failure. 

Don't be second iteration me. 

Be first iteration me. 

Keep it stupid simple by learning one thing at a time. 

Our brains love clear goals. Clear goals aren't inherently motivating (that is what making the project your own does), but they remove roadblocks (read excuses) our brain would otherwise create to avoid doing work.

In hindsight, if I were to salvage my project, I'd learn Raspberry Pi first, then get a camera working, then build an assembly for a DS, then play with computer vision and then never touch machine learning because it's stupid to try on a Raspberry Pi. 

## Make It Your Own
While learning on the job is nice, sometimes you need a sandbox to learn in. 

Last quarter, when learning about Amazon Web Services, our Accelerator cohort created a fake app with the help of the estimable Joe Chrysler. Not only did the app focus our learning, it gave us a sense of ownership. 

Crafting a project to address your stupid simple learning goal gets your emotions involved. 

As all of us know, we care more about things we own (at least most of the time). 

For learning the basics, boilerplate tutorials work well, but to make things stick, we have to take things to the next emotional level. 

What is a problem that bugs you at home? What's an idea you've sat on for years but never given a shot? 

These projects could be anything. My coworker is making her fridge smart with a Raspberry Pi. I'm redoing a tennis score keeping app from college so I actually know what's happening at my girlfriend's sisters tennis matches. 

The only thing they need to be is your own. 

Boilerplate starter kits like this one for Ruby on Rails are great for getting your momentum (they give you a small win) but can only take you so far. 

To dive deep, you need to dig deep. And to dig deep, you need to get personal. 

## Make it Communal

There is a real misconception that programming is a lonely endeavor. I've talked about what people who aren't in tech think of us before (LINK), but I failed to mention this tidbit. Even with a whole book written to disprove it ([[The Innovator's - How a group of Hacker's, Geniuses and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution]]), the perception still exists that you can magically learn to become a coding wizard alone.

Ever looked over your coworker's shoulder and seen something like this?

Not only is it impossible to see their dark mode screen, it's covered with strange symbols that mind as well be hieroglyphs. 

What you are seeing there is indeed another language. In this article you will learn about the pros and cons of these foreign languages so that next time you can contribute to the conversation. 

To prepare for this article, I went out and virtually interviewed some real, live developers in their natural habitat. Below are the programming languages they love best and why.

## Language
- Typescript
	- Flexibility of JavaScript paired with strong and expressive typing.
	- Can run in browser and server side, static types are great for unfamiliar code bases, functions are first class objects, lots of automated testing options, incorporates a lot of functional programming concepts.
	- It's been really fun to learn! It's forced me think about certain technical decisions and how to model parts of a project's architecture in different (and powerful) ways when working on features that I probably wouldn't have approached in the same way if we didn't enforce type safety (which has saved us from future headaches). I also like that I can usually drill into types and fairly quickly gain knowledge about how certain parts of the architecture are related.
- Ruby
	- It's minimal, easy to read, lots of open source libraries, and has awesome meta-programming capabilities.
	- Ruby is a great language for scripting and general purpose programming tasks. It's my default option if I want to write a quick script and I often enjoy programming in Ruby more than other languages. With that being said, there are many things I despise about it. I don't find it to be a great option when working with a team, but for solo development it's great.
- F#
	- It's concise, expressive, and easier to write correct code
- Python
	- Simple, abstracts a lot, less worried about memory issues
- Clojure
	- Highly interactive, strong tools for metaprogramming and DSL building

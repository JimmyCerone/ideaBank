Return to the office

A few weeks ago I wrote the start of a post about returning to the office. In it, I said we might be asking the wrong question, “In person or remote?” I proposed that our main concern should instead be how well we collaborate. 

I stand by that framing and I think it’s an important distinction to make. Atomic Object is all about collaboration after all. We are also a multi office company. No matter what we do, we will inevitably have to learn to collaborate, whether it be in person or remote. 

Yet after a week of working in person, I’m not sure collaboration is the most important thing about working in the office. In fact, I think it’s a symptom of the real reason we work in person: trust. 

It’s hard to argue that good collaboration can exist without trust (just take a look at our government). Yet it’s not so obvious why trust is created best in person. 

I think emerging from the pandemic, where life on the screen became normal, we struggle to realize what we lost in the retreat. As adaptable as we are, we can often forget just what our past selves felt like. 

So instead of talking about our experience on screen, I’d like to talk about my dog’s. My puppy is now almost a year old. As long as my girlfriend and I have had him, we’ve been separated by 30 minutes and 30 miles, which means a lot of back and forth for the little guy. It also means a lot of Facetime. 

What I find interesting about this is that my dog so obviously reacts differently to us on Facetime than in person. While this may sound obvious, I’m not sure it is. This idea is obvious in dogs but subtle in humans. We understand screens and Facetime and thus feel like we are still getting the same human contact out of it, slightly diminished. 

Dogs, on the other hand, don’t understand the concept of Facetime (or at least I don’t think they do). So they react to the reality of it, rather than the theory of it. In theory, Facetime is a viable replacement for human contact. And don’t get me wrong, it’s a wonderful invention. But, I think we overvalue it. Dogs, who are more in touch with reality than us, get it. 

When I say hi to my dog via Facetime, his ears perk up and he wags his tail, until he realizes I’m not there. Then he’s off to more interesting things. He knows I am not really there. 

I think we sometimes forget that these amazing tools we have aren’t teleportation. They are projection. They project parts of us, lower fidelity than the real thing. 

And I think we also forget that we are not so different than dogs. We are both new to the game of digital technology. Just as my dog doesn’t understand FaceTime, nor do I, at least not really. I don’t know it’s long term effects, or how it interacts with my biology. 

My understanding of its effects are coarse grained at best. Fuzzy and imprecise.

## Context
- I came across this idea in [[How Bad Do You Want It? by Matt Fitzgerald]] with the story about a man who lost his arm in a roofing accident. Pre-accident, he had been a great wrestler. Post accident, he was depressed and struggling. Then he came upon triathlons and became dominant, developing new "workarounds" as the author calls it to enable him to bike, run, and swim. Another running lost most of her thigh to cancer and then became even faster, even with only 2 muscles in her leg.

The author of [[How Bad Do You Want It? by Matt Fitzgerald]] calls this the "Workaround Effect"

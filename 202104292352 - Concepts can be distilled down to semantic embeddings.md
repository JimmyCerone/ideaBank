## Reflections
- Just as a picture can be represented in 1's and 0's, a concept can be defined by semantic embeddings, which are used to understand text in chat bots and search engines ([[Search engines cast too wide a net]]). What's super weird is that given this presupposition, you can say some things about the properties of concepts (reminds me of [[Quantum Country by Andu Mutaschak and Michael Nielson]]):
	- Conceptual differences correspond to geometric distances
		- So you could say how closely related ideas are (potentially even using [[Obsidian]]).
	- Conceptual Parallelism corresponds to geometric parallelism
		- Not sure what this means, or what properties this would give. Wild though. Could it mean that some ideas have no intersections? Or that you could "build" squares with them?

## Reflections
- I had this experience so many times in my life, starting with Mr. Brooks in 5th grade and continuing through college with Math Phys. Such a troubling #Problem though I have to imagine systems like Obsidian and Remnote would have remedied these problems. 
- Connects once again to ideas from [[Love's Executioner]], like [[03-04-2021 - False perceptions of other's perceptions of you can trap you]] - we often cannot understand our own lack of understanding. The same problem I pointed out with [[How do you see the world]]. 

## Questions
- How can we detect when we think we have #Knowledge but don't?

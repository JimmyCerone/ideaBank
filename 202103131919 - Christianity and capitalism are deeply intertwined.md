This will be a looong one I think. There's a lot to untangle here. What got me thinking about this was seeing [[03132021 - The gospel of enterprise has been used for centuries to demean outsiders]] in [[King Leopold's Ghost]]. There's just so much here. The fact that [[202103131859 - Poverty has its roots in history]] is not acknowledged but it's viewed in a personal light. So much #History. Really want to dig deeper into this one. 


I wonder if part of this connection is because of [[202103131751 - Power imbalances attract those who seek control]]. #Christianity became the #Religious desire of the powerful with Constantine. Then #Capitalism worked well for the powerful because [[03132021 - People with capital use dreams of prosperity to inspire others to take risks]]. 

## Examples
- St. Patrick's day and St. Valentine's day made major #Corporations huge amounts of #Money

## Quotes
- From King Leopold's Ghost:
	> When he served as the lay business manager of a Baptist Mission Station, he drew some gentle disapproval from his employer, who thought he didn't bargain hard enough at buying food. "He is very good to the natives, too good, too generous, too ready to give away. He would never made money as a trader."

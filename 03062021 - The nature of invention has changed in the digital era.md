## Reflection
- I'm not sure I'm right here. I remember being in #Chemistry class in #College and thinking about how much low hanging fruit there was. I imagine that was because there was a whole new intellectual paradigm going on that gave lots of fresh ideas (ironically from [[Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World by Jack Weatherford]], not the West).
- I've wondered about this for a long time because there seem to be less paradigm shifts these days. This is probably in part because I'm always on #ProductHunt which is not where all the newest things happen. It's more about incremental #Innovation than paradigm changes. 


## Questions
- Will there be a new intellectual paradigm soon? Is there already one?
- Is it true that #Inventions have changed? Is the bar higher? 
- Where can you find out about paradigm changing innovation? Universities?

## Quotes
- From [[The Wright Brothers by David]]:
> There was beginning a great deal of talk about man's no longer having the opportunity he once had of achieving greatness. Too many people were beginning to believe that all of the world's problems had been solved.

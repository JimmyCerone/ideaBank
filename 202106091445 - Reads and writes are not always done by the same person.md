## Idea
- This means the [[03062021 - Levers]] are quite different than I'd previously considered. With filtering, you can change the cost of reading and with responsibilities divided well you can significantly cut down the difficulty of writes and reads. 


## Connections
- Most of my ideas around this were based on individuals, but the team work at [[Atomic Object]] has forced me to widen my view of [[202103261011 - Knowledge management depends on reads and writes]]. Specifically, I started this update process by acknowledging that [[202106091410 - Database reads are unevenly distributed across groups]]. 
## Example
- I might write a bug and then Nora might read it. Meaning the database grew by 1 item but my reads didn't increase at all.

## Idea
- This means that the bias should be to surfacing information as much as possible because the goal is to keep the distribution manageable given the context.
	- Some high distribution is ok, like when [[Jordan Nelson]] knows a ton about the Price Edit page.
	- Some high distribution is not ok, like when I am the only one who knows about bugs.

## Connections
- Connects to all of my thoughts on distribution. This seems like something that has the potential for an evergreen note... #Evergreen

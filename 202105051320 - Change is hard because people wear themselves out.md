## Reflections
- Change requires high levels of self control and [[202105051112 - Self control is a limited quantity]], like a muscle, as pointed out in [[How Bad Do You Want It? by Matt Fitzgerald]].

## Example
- Me most of my life. I did a terrible job of sticking to the principle that [[Do 1 new habit at a time]] and spun my wheels constantly. 
- Part of the terrible assumption inherent in [[202105081905 - Binary programs create bad incentives]] and solutions that ignore second order consequences ([[Principles by Ray Dalio]]) is that people can quickly change. Change is hard! That's why we need to invest in education in all areas.

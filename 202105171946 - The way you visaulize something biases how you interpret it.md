## Idea
- How you represent a number or word determines how you interpret because we are so heavily dependent on context ([[The Righteous Mind by Jonathon Haidt]]) and use so many shortcuts ([[Thinking Fast and Slow]])
## Connections
- Kind of the root of [[202105171942 - Measuring something changes your relationship to it]] & [[03-03-2021 - Our language creates our reality]] as both numbers and language are ways to "visualize" concepts. 
## Example
- Judging a book by it's cover
- Graphs where the axis doesn't start at 0

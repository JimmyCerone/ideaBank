## Idea
- An interesting #Risk that comes with [[03062021 - Small obscure journals can be a fertile source of the early jump]] is that smaller journals likely have less oversight. 
- All this is disconcerting in light of [[The Righteous Mind by Jonathon Haidt]] and our lack of #Rational thought. Could lead to further splintering, kind of a return to the local newspapers of a time long ago, seen I believe in [[Why We're Polarized by Ezra Klein]].

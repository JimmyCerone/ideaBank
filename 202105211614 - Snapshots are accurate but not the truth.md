## Idea
- Snapshots are a picture of something in a slice of time (whether it be data or an actual picture) and area accurate for that slice of time but don't tell you anything about the [[Growth by Vaclov Smil]] patterns. 
## Connections
- I see this as similar to [[202104211317 - Inductive reasoning is often misused when addressing systemic problems]]. Lots of people talk about today's snapshot but ignore #History. [[Misreading Scripture with Western Eyes by E. Randolph Richards and Brandon J. O'Brien]] does a great job of talking about this problem in the concept of theology especially in the case of women in the church. They point out that the church was always progressive and therefore should continue to be progressive because of the teleological nature of scripture. 
- I feel like there are more connections but they aren't coming to mind at the moment...

## Example
- Mammograms give you an idea of where tumors are at but doesn't tell you anything about their patterns of growth, which is the "truth" about how serious the tumor is.

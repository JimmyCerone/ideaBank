## Idea


## Connections
- Kind of see this in [[The Emperor of All Maladies by Siddartha Mukherjee]] which talks about how information is the basis of everything with DNA and even below that with molecular biology (structures leads to function)
- The source of this idea is [[The Information - A History, A Theory, A Flood by james Gleick]] which talks about the #History  of information itself, which is a weird concept and one that is hard to wrap my head around. In that, he talks about Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, like in [[The Innovator's - How a group of Hacker's, Geniuses and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution]]. Here though he makes a connection that Isaacson doesn't, which is that Babbage is treating information as a commodity and as something that energy can be converted into, like grain. 
- An interesting corollary to this is [[202104222251 - Data is currency]] & [[202105241936 - Information is a commodity]]. 
- I'm curious about the connection between [[202105022055 - Optimizing information processing is better than optimizing information input]]. This almost seems like dieting for the mind given that energy can be transformed into information. Reminds me of [[Zero to One by Peter Thiel]] in that how you convert that energy is important. You can spend your energy replicating or innovating. 
## Example
- Babbage's first computer, which took steam and turned into into math.

## Reflections
- As I've worked on building out my [[Obsidian]] mind, I've started to look at the information I consume differently (a perfect example of [[202104222250 - Our tools create our reality]]). Kind of another layer on [[202103261011 - Knowledge management depends on reads and writes]]. Lately, I've been trying to capture in my head what is so different. From what I can tell, there are 2 kinds of information I consume: 
	- Facts
	- Ideas

## Facts

Facts are fun to know. That's things like the mail system that existed in the Mongol Empire (see [[Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World by Jack Weatherford]]). Facts are the source of [[042120211326 - Inductive Reasoning]] and are important to collect, though I haven't found a good way of doing so yet because they are so damn hard to classify. What's important? What's not? Add on to that the fact that facts can be looked up and you end up with a conundrum. At this point, I've just minimized this [[03062021 - Levers]] and barely track any facts since they can be looked up. 

## Ideas
- Ideas are different. In my [[Limit my consumption of books and articles]] I'm trying to focus on idea focused articles as opposed to fact based articles. Fact based articles I can skim, while idea based articles I have to chew on. Still haven't found a good way to do that. Printing them? Buying a remarkable? Kindle?

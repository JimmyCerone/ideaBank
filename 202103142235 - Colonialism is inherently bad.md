## Context
From [[King Leopold's Ghost]]:
> If he (Morel) had believed, as we might conclude today, that Leopold's rape of the Congo was in part a logical consequence of the very idea of #Colonialism, of the #Belief that there was nothing wrong with a country being ruled other than by its own inhabitants, Morel would have been written of as being on the fringe. 

## Connections
- This #Idea seems a direct consequence of [[202103131751 - Power imbalances attract those who seek control]], which is often abused. This, in my opinion, is why #Colonialism is inherent bad. It implies a power differential. 
- Goes directly counter to [[202103142236 - Evangelical Imperialism]], which says the #Power imbalance doesn't necessarily corrupt. 
- Similar to [[202103142226 - Bottom up is the best way to reform existing structures]] like #Commnist #System, the power is too concentrated for this form of #Government to be effective or even #Efficiency. 
- Makes me think of [[How do you see the world]] and implies an interesting twist on [[Shared realities with different interpretations]] because this idea has changed over time. 


## Questions
-  How does one avoid a power differential? Is there any evidence of two different groups meeting with #Respect?
-  What of parenting? Isn't that a power differential? How do you avoid misusing the differential? Can it be eliminated?
-  Are power differentials always bad?
-  How do opinions change over time? Why do they whip saw?

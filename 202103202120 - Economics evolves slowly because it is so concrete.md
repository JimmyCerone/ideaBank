## Idea
From Joe: 
> There really are not all that many powerful economic ideologies out there; economics seems to me the slowest philosophy to evolve, perhaps because we build such concrete systems upon such abstract ideas. It's harder to change infrastructure than thoughts, and that dissuades people from thinking too much (I'm theorizing here).

## Reflection
- Kind of tucked in here is the idea that there aren't many powerful #Economics ideologies out there, which seems like a [[03062021 - Levers]] to me. Could that mean they are easier to learn than other fields? Or at least have a small solution set to master?

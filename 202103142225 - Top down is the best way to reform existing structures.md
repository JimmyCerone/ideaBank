## Context
- This view is advocated by those like E.D. Morel in [[King Leopold's Ghost]]. He was a member of the Nonconformists (Protestant but not of the #Church of #England) who were similar to the Clapham Sect (a #Humanitarian evangelical group).
	- The group worked on improving conditions for all sorts of groups: prisoners, factory workers, child laborers, the insane. 

## Reflection
- I find myself in an interesting spot with this approach. It feels comfortable and undoubtedly does some good, yet I don't think it goes far enough. You can only do so much within the confines of a particular system. 

## Connections
- These people would likely disagree that [[202103131859 - Poverty has its roots in history]]. They would also disagree that [[03-01-2021 - We shouldn't help the poor - Tragedy of the Commons -  Garrett Hardin]], which puts them in an interesting space. Further complicating things, in part because of their belief that #Poverty is not necessarily based on #History (and thus the current #System), the would disagree with this: [[03-01-2021 - Choosing to spend money on non necessities requires you to deal with the opportunity cost of saving a child's life]].

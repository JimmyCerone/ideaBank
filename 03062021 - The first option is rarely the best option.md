## Context
- I can't remember where I first came across this idea, though I suspect it was in [[Factfulness]]. I was reminded of it while reading [[The Wright Brothers by David]], where Wilbur warns of the danger of someone falling into the first line of business they come across and sticking with it. Wilbur's insistence upon [[03062021 - Intellectual curiosity is the best thing you can pass down]] helps counter this instinct, though it takes monstrous courage to follow through. Reminds me of the book my dad gave me about careers and [[Designing Your Life]]. 

## Reflection
- I think how [[Neil]] and I designed our Idea Explorers experiment helps counter this tendency. It's important to have #Systems and things in place to make sure you don't run into this.

> There is always a danger that a person of this disposition will, if left to depend upon himself, retire into the first corner he falls into and remain there all his life struggling for bare existence (unless some earthquake throws him out into a more favorable location), where if put on the right path with proper special equipment, he would advance far. Many men are better fitted for improving chances offered them than in turning up the chances themselves.

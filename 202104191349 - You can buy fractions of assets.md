## Reflections
- A new idea that is not based on #Cryptocurrency, but is similar to it ([[202104191440 - Crypto enables micropayments]]). Fascinating because it uses [[03062021 - Levers]] to involve more investors. Not sure if they benefit as much as one might think though. Lots of hurdles are present for retail investors still.

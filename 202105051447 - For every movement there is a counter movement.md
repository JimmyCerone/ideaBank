## Idea
- Fascinating concept and a really interesting way to find Niches. Kind of want to do this with [[Neil]] and combine with [[202105051730 - Kevin Kelly on the Tim Ferriss Show]]'s idea to do what's uniquely you and [[202105051642 - Double down on wins - spend your energy doing more on what's working]].

## Example
- Martha Stewart writing a bunch of books for women about cooking during the Feminism movement of the 70's and 80's.

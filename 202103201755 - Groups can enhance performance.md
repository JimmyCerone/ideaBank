## Context
- I came across the sub idea of this in [[How Bad Do You Want It? by Matt Fitzgerald]] as it applied to endurance sports. In that book, it applied on two levels: 
	- Micro: Running in a group is easier
	- Macro: Running in a culture crazy about running (like Kenya) is easier

## Connections
- An interesting connection exists here because this is actually a coping skill, running within groups. In my opinion, it is one of the easier ones to take advantage. All this is based on the idea that [[202103201743 - Coping skills can be developed]]. 
- Can this idea be generalized like [[202103201742 - Coping skills are generalizeable]]? Can participation in one group improve your performance in other groups? What about churches?

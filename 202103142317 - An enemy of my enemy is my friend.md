## Context
- In [[King Leopold's Ghost]], both #Segregationists and #Abolitionists were on the same side when it came to cleaning up the #Congo. Segregationists worried they couldn't send #AfricanAmericans s back to #Africa if it were known to be bad and everyone else worried because they were normal caring people.

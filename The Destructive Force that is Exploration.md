### The Destructive Force that is Exploration

#### Why exploring is a synonym for destruction

When I first wrote this story, I was at the [Oregon Extension](https://www.oregonextension.org/) just getting my feet wet in the writing world. One of my favorite professors of all time was pushing me along the path to writing. As part of that pathway, we all did a #Nature writing exercise where we had to sit still for an hour outside.

Naturally, I couldn’t stand sitting still for any more than 5 minutes, in part because of the fly I talk about, but also because I’m a jittery kid.

To cut the boredom of sitting in nature, I started poking around. I did everything but turn over rocks, which I’m thankful for as I later found out all of them have scorpions under them. In the process of poking around, observed the insides of a busted tree and the mysterious recesses of a cocoon.

After reflecting and writing about my time outside, I realized the tension between my exploration and it’s effects. While it was great that I learned what was inside a cocoon (nothing much), I also had to destroy a cocoon to find out what was in it.

This reflection throws a wrench in my self-image as an explorer because it necessitates that I’m a destroyer at the same time. Exploration always destroys something, whether it be an old conception of something or a physical object like that poor cocoon.

To make this connection more serious, exploration in history has almost always been associated with exploitation and destruction. Whether you take the Mongols and [[Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World by Jack Weatherford]] as your example or [[King Leopold's Ghost]], exploration and destruction are like thunder and rain. When you hear one coming, the other is not far behind.

Yet, as you likely realize, it’s not that simple. You see, in the terminology of [[Principles by Ray Dalio]], destruction is the first order consequence of exploration. In some cases, the second order consequence is not so bad. By exploring the structure of wheat through it’s purposeful destruction for study, we have been able to create hardier strains and feed more people.

The real catch with exploration then, is the second order consequence. Is it for good or for naught? Even with this framework, it’s not such a simple answer. Are we to say the means justify the end? Some would say that’s a slippery slope. I have no doubt it is, but such questions are beyond me.

All I will leave you with is the little story I wrote about my time outside for you to think on. Was my #Exploration worth it? Is yours?

Flies suck. I’ve realized by now they aren’t going to bite me or otherwise harm me, but I still want to kill them. They mess with my leg hair and I’m ticklish. I wonder if maybe the Native Americans had a trick for this.

Now I’m checking my watch. I set a timer for 5 minutes and promised I wouldn’t look. Too late. Time is slow.

I think I’m hearing things. A rustle here, a rustle there. In my mind it’s an axe murderer.

Speaking of unsafe, I’ve moved and I hear a new noise. There it is once. It’s odd. I ignore it. I hear it again. And again. It sounds like a washboard. Definitely not an axe murderer.

I’m a slow thinker, but I finally it together: it’s a rattlesnake. I move. But, I move slowly, almost reluctantly.

Odd how flies move me, but a rattlesnake barely does. I walk back carefully.

I realize, on the way, the rattlesnake was warning me. Which was nice of him. I should go back and say thanks. I don’t.

I see a tree. It fell. Or it got pushed. I wasn’t there to see. It’s broken now. Poor thing.

I’d never seen the inside of a tree. Until now. Imagine a brain with a hard shell. It’s gorgeous, enchanting.

It’s sad we only see wholly in brokenness.

I just broke open a cocoon to see what was in it. I did it in the name of understanding and exploration. I feel bad for that.

I ask myself: Must discovery be born from destruction? I leave, with broken grass trailing behind me.

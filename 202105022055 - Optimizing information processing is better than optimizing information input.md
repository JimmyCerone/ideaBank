## Reflections
- There are 3 [[03062021 - Levers]] I can pull on when thinking about [[Change how I handle information input]]:
	- How I select info ([[Limit my consumption of books and articles]])
	- How I process info
	- How much info I process

Still not sure how I want to pull on these but I'm thinking hard about it after reading [[The Autobiography of Malcolm X by Malcolm X]] and rethinking so damn much. That book has a huge impact and I want to read more like it. That book makes me want to reread it and compare it with [[Black Power and Black Theology by James Cone]], [[The Color of Water by James McBride]], and [[How to Be Antiracist by Ibram X. Kendi]]. That's the type of thing I want to read more of, something that makes me rethink how I think about other things. 

What I'm realizing here is that what I should be aiming for is books with big ideas, like [[Dopesick by Beth Macy]] ([[042320211016 - Harm Reduction]]) that influence everything. It's hard to predict those ([[Black Swan by Nassim Taleb]]), which makes this all the more challenging. Got lots of thinking left to go there. The best way to do it, in my mind, is [[Read uncommon sources of information]]. Reminds me of [[03062021 - Small obscure journals can be a fertile source of the early jump]]. That's a good question to think about, especially in light of [[202104070856 - The future is already here, it's just not evenly distributed]]. A wrinkle here is that [[03072021 - The future is predicted and shaped by fiction]], which I rarely read. Will have to think more on that.

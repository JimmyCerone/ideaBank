Another point from [[Black Power and Black Theology by James Cone]]. This one is a little contested. Kendi in [[How to Be Antiracist by Ibram X. Kendi]] would disagree and I side more with Kendi here. That said, I do think Cone makes a worthwhile point here in saying that according to the definition of racism, what most white people call reverse racism is more like dislike or even simply boundaries. Hating someone because they are hurtful or you assume they are is different than assuming you are superior. 

What's interesting here is that whites in this case are using [[202104120847 - Words aren't well defined]] as a weapon. Sad and unfortunate. 

> But the charge of black racism cannot be reconciled with the facts. While it is true that blacks do hate whites, black hatred is not racism. Racism, according to Webster, is "the assumption that psychocultural traits and capacities are determined by biological race and that races differ decisively from one another, which is usually coupled with a belief in the inherent superiority of a particular race and its rights to dominance over others." Where are the examples among blacks in which they sought to assert their right to dominance over others because of a belief in black superiority?

## Idea
- From [[Neil]]'s email update: 
	- This is not type one fun. When I was describing my experience to another hiker, he said it was type two fun. This was a new concept to me, but one I like. Type one fun is what we traditionally think of as fun. It is enjoyable in the moment. Then there is type two fun which is challenging or frustrating or difficult in the moment, but when you look back on it the experience is remembered as fun. So is this fun? Answer: very little type one fun, but hopefully this will be a time rich with type two fun.

## Reflections
- An idea from [[Neil]] that I find fascinating. Reminds me of [[Will to Meaning vs Pleasure]] - seems like Type 1 fun is [[03-01-2021 - Will to Pleasure by Freud]] and type 2 fun is [[03-01-2021 - Will to meaning Viktor Frankl]].

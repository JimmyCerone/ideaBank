Esther Perelle points this out in [[Mating in Captivity by Esther Perelle]]. What seemed spontaneous early on was a result of lots of planning and lots of clearing of schedules. Thus, what seemed spontaneous was planned. The planning though was the creation of a space to welcome the #Eroticism in. The work is in creating a space where you can be spontaneous. That's the goal. 

Love this, which sums it up nicely: 

> “If you don’t want sex to be another item on your to-do list, don’t treat it like one,” I respond. “I’m not talking about scheduling sex, I’m talking about creating an erotic space, and that takes time. What will occur in that space is open-ended, but the space itself is marked by intentionality. Like that osso buco you made for Raoul last weekend—it didn’t just happen.”

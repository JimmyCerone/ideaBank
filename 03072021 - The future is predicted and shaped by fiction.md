## Context
- HG Wells, shortly after the [[The Wright Brothers by David]] proved flight was possible, predicted that #War would go to the air with bombs dropped and nowhere safe. 

## Idea
- I often go to #Nonfiction to find out what will happen in the future, yet nonfiction is often about what has already happened. While Nick Bostrom did his best to predict the future in [[Superintelligence]], it lacked the vitality a #Fiction book might have. Fiction helps us imagine in bright colors a future that doesn't exist. 


## Question
- How do you discern which books will give you insights into the #Future and which are simply fun?

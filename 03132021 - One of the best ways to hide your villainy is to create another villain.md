## Context
- Learned this most recently while watching [[Burn Notice]]. Michael pitted two mob bosses against each other by making them seem like #Villain s when he was the one screwing them over the whole time. 


## Examples
- [[King Leopold's Ghost]] used this sickeningly well. To get into the Congo, he claimed he was freeing the locals from Arab #Slave traders. All the while, he was enslaving the local population and exporting all their goods without pay. But few knew that and it took a looong time to get out. By creating a false enemy, he was able to hide his misdeeds. 
	- Later, to cover their #History, #Belgium has said that #Disease was the main culprit for the deaths, ignoring the fact that most [[202103142258 - Genocides occur indirectly]].

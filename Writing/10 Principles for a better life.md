I wrote this story the first time after the summer of 2018. In the summer of 2018, I worked a 2 jobs and tried to start a company. By the end of the summer, I was exhausted, burnt out, and cynical. I’d lost the company I tried to start, almost lost my best friend, and was spinning out of control. Luckily for me, I was headed to the #OregonExtension  [Oregon Extension](https://www.oregonextension.org/), which helped me get my head on straight.

At the time of writing this blog, I had no idea things were going to get better. To try to avoid the same hardships, I wrote out 10 lessons I learned, which turned into these 10 principles after some editing.

### Short Version

1.  The Rule of Time Friction
2.  The Rule of 10,000 Hours
3.  The Rule of 3
4.  The Rule of People
5.  The Rule of Comparison
6.  The Rule of Persistence
7.  The Rule of the Amoeba
8.  The Rule of _Cool_ People
9.  The Rule of Youth
10.  The Rule of Feedback

### The Long Version

#### 1\. The Rule of #Time Friction

First, the more you try to split your time, the more time you lose to “friction”. In the summer of 2018, I split my time between 2 different companies while trying to start my own.

Lots of time is lost in this splitting, whether it’s the physical commute from one place to another, the emotional strain of maintaining 3X the relationships, or the mental strain of keeping 3X the information in your head.

I wrote in more depth on this topic a while back, so if this “Rule of Time Friction” intrigues you, check [out more here.](https://medium.com/the-business-of-being-happy-and-healthy/how-not-to-be-a-busy-body-say-no-to-the-small-things-8eeaa1bbef1c)

#### 2\. The Rule of 10,000 Hours

Second, to do anything well you have to do it a lot. Malcolm Gladwell coined this the “10,000 hour rule” in his excellent book, [Outliers](https://www.alibris.com/Outliers-The-Story-of-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/book/10832715?matches=1571). The Rule of 10,000 hours builds on the rule of time friction because it’s hard to get in 10,000 at any one thing if you are doing tons of them.

Getting to the magical 10,000 hours requires focus and limits so that you minimize the amount of time you lost to friction.

#### 3\. The Rule of 3

Third, you can only do about 3 things well. Limit projects, books, and everything else to 3.

-   3 allows you to ideate and learn whereas any more and you are just putting out fires all the time and never taking work to the next level.

#### 4\. The Rule of #People

Fourth, working with knowledgeable folks is best.

-   Base where you work on who knows most.
-   Work with folks who open your mind to new worlds, not folks who make you feel stupid.
-   Smart, mean people will rarely help you any more than kind beginners can.
-   Note: Not all kind people are nice.

#### 5\. The Rule of Comparison

Fifth, compare yourself to your past self, not to others. Are you getting better? Should you take a rest? Those are much better questions than how am I doing in relation to my coworkers?

To be more specific, when I say compare yourself to your past self, I mean reflect on your past and your [world view](https://medium.com/the-business-of-being-happy-and-healthy/how-do-you-see-the-world-3f04b3256758). In the summer of 2018, I never slowed down to reflect this summer. I viewed productivity as working all the time and thus never took time to do the most valuable thing: reflect.

Taking time to look at how and why you work is the most important thing you can do.

#### 6\. The Rule of Persistence

Sixth, look long and document. By persistence, I do mean look to the long term, but I also mean persist your work. Write down your decisions like Ray Dalio recommends in [Principles](https://www.alibris.com/Principles-Life-and-Work-Ray-Dalio/book/38084548?matches=24) so you can reflect and improve later.

-   You can’t prove the work you did if you didn’t write it down. Practice writing and rehearsing how to talk about your experience.

#### 7\. The Rule of the Amoeba

Seventh, amorphous tasks are inherently stresseful. Expect that.

When I was running my startup into the ground, I thought I was out of line for being stressed out. I wish I’d realized that startups are inherently stressful. There is no one there to tell you how to do things because you are innovating. There is no blueprint or playbook. And that’s exciting, but also stressful.

#### 8\. The Rule of Cool People

Eighth, you work with cool people. Go out of your way to spend time with them.

-   I focused so much on meeting new people and networking that I missed the fantastic coworkers around me. I still go to know them but little things like taking them out to lunch goes a long way.

The rule of time friction strikes again here. If you spend time with a million different people, never focusing on any small group of them, you will never build any solid relationships.

Meet lots of people, but focus in on a few you really enjoy.

#### 9\. The Rule of Youth

Ninth, realize you are still young. Time moves slower than you think and there is no such thing as “behind” whatever age you are. You always have time to pause and reflect.

-   Not everyone is Mark Zuckerburg. It will take years to discover what you are best at and more years to become the best at that.
-   Realize that success is not equivalent to power or status.

#### 10\. The Rule of #Feedback

Tenth, feedback is everything.

-   If you don’t know how things are going you will struggle to improve them.
-   Data is not everything but recognize it’s value. Getting data is hard. Getting good data is harder.
-   Before soliciting feedback call to mind your goals. Unfocused, useless feedback is worse than none at all.

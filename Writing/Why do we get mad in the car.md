### Why Do We Get Mad in the Car?

#### The #Dehumanizing power of our metal boxes

Do you ever wonder who is in the #Car next to you?

Do you ever wonder why we get so angry at a person you’ve never met for cutting you off during rush hour?

Why do cars elicit the worst in us?

For some, cars are great rolling metal buckets of fear — they fill our minds with accidents, broken limbs, and broken families.

For others, cars are like a kettle — heating us up to a boil because of all the inconsiderate, incompetent folks out there.

For still others (including me), cars are a toy meant for playing obnoxiously loud music and driving just a tad too fast.

Whatever the case, I think cars provoke such extreme reactions because they are so damn dehumanizing.

The darker side of fast transport.

When was the last time you looked another driver in the eyes?

I, normally a very careful human, can be a bit reckless when driving, partly because I can’t see anyone else. In an odd way, driving for me is an escape from the usual social anxiety I face because in a sense, I am alone.

A friend of mine, who is normally a kind and caring guy, boils over with road rage. I suspect he allows this part of himself to emerge because there are no social consequences.

Years ago, I became anxious in cars — in part because I couldn’t exert any social control over the other shiny metal boxes on the road. There was no way to pacify the hurtling hunk of metal coming perilously close.

Much talk is made of our devices being dehumanizing, but what of the bigger devices that carry us around every day?

Are these not in some small way contributing to our increasing separation?

Many of us (pre-Pandemic) spend hundreds of hours of our lives separated by glass windows as we speed past people we will never meet. Our transportation is separate, apart.

I’m not sure whether this apartness is a cause or effect of our #Polarized society, but I do know it’s part of the equation somehow.

That’s why I want to challenge you in the next week to look to your left and right the next time you are at a stoplight.

Ask: Who are these people I share a dark strip of tarmac with?

Wonder: Where are they going today?

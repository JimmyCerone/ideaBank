## Idea
- Not acting is actually an active choice, thus making it an action in and of itself. 
## Connections
- Much like there are only racist and antiracist actions and no neutral actions ([[How to Be Antiracist by Ibram X. Kendi]]), there are no actions that "do nothing" anywhere. Any action, even inaction, is a form of action. 


## Example
- Not imposing any restrictions during the pandemic is inaction that results in effects, effectively making it an action

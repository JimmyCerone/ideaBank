## Context
- I first came across this idea in [[How Bad Do You Want It? by Matt Fitzgerald]]. The idea that was pounded into me by the book that led to this idea is that [[202103201743 - Coping skills can be developed]]. The author had lots of fascinating stories about athletes becoming more patient, present, and resilient over time

## Idea
- The overarching theory is that coping skills can be developed in a specific context then taken elsewhere. This is a powerful [[03062021 - Levers]] and makes me want to look more into coping skills. Some are effective (workaround) while others can be self destructive (drinking to cope). 

## Questions
- Would I be able to make a list of my coping skills and swap them out one by one?

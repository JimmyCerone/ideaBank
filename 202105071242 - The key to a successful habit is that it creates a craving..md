## Idea
- I think I'm still working out exactly what this means. What is the difference between a reward that creates a craving and one that doesn't? Really trying to think about this as [[Exercising 5 days a week]] is becoming a habit. How can I crave it? Going to [[Martha's Vineyard]] seems to help. That might be it. Want to incorporate going to the farmers market as well next week. 

## Example
- Tons of examples in the business world, the most interesting being the one about tooth paste, where no one brushed their teeth pre WWI and it became an issue of national security then pepsi dent blew everything out of the water by getting everyone to crave the tingling sensation created by their toothpaste.

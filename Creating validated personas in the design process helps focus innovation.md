## Context
- Comes from the #Design teachings at #AtomicObject given by Kim.

## Reflections
- The biggest learning from this was the difference between validated and proto #Personas. Most companies don't validate their assumptions and are stuck with proto personas. Atomic uses interviews to create validated personas. 
- Personas are interesting because they give you a concrete "person" to design your product for. 
- The process of coming up with #Personas comes after the research phase. 

## Facts
4 Types of Personas: 
	1. Goal Directed
	2. Role Based
	3. Story based
	4. Proto Persona (this one doesn't seem to fit)

## Context
- In [[King Leopold's Ghost]], the author notes that Leopold's interest in young (16 and younger) #Europeans #Women did more to harm his reputation than what he did in the #Congo. 

## Idea
- #Crime committed against in group members is taken more seriously than that committed by out group members. You can see this everywhere from the Storming of the Capital vs 9/11 to Leopold's case. 


## Examples
- [[03132021 - Manifest destiny]] was a fine #Idea as long as it was held by the in group. It is considered intimidating and threatening to the out group. 
- Sleeping around is tolerated among white males and #Rape is normalized (see the Stanford Swimmer) yet #Immigrants from #Mexico are villified as rapists. The same #Crime is treated differently across groups. 
- Crack vs cocaine. Cocaine carries a lighter sentence even though it's the same drug as crack. 

## Connections
- I feel that this idea is why [[202103131859 - Poverty has its roots in history]] is not more widely accepted. If #Poverty is because of others, that is more tolerable than accepting the crimes of the in group.

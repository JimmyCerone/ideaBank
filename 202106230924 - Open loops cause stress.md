## Idea
- Open loops are thoughts that have not been brought to a stopping point. David Allen's claim in [[Getting Things Done by David Allen]] is that these open loops cause us significant stress. 
## Connections
- Kind of the root problem of [[Finding savings everywhere in your budget at once is stressful]] and many others related to change. 
	- Part of the reason change is so hard is because of these open loops, which is obliquely addressed in [[202105051416 - Aiming at the Rider gives direction but not motivation]] and others from both [[The Power of Habits by Charles Duhigg]] and [[Switch - How to Change Things When Change is Hard by Dan and Chip Heath]]
## Example
- Having lots of to dos running around your head that have no "next action" item.

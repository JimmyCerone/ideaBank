## Context
- There is ample evidence of this in the tech world. [[Jan Gurlich]] was the first to introduce me to this idea and since I've heard it from [[Basecamp]] and [[DuckDuckGo]]. In an interesting twist, I came across this idea again in [[King Leopold's Ghost]], where the #King gave away #Newspapers as a form of #Propaganda.


## Connections
- Part of the proof that [[03062021 - Business is a war that not everyone is cut out for]] is the fact that things are given out for free to put others out of #Business (thing #Gmail)

## Idea
- Kind of a corollary of [[03-03-2021 - Our language creates our reality]], we can't conceive of something if we can't name it. That's a weird way of putting it, but it's true. 

## Example
- Naming technology as a concept allowed us to understand it as something other than tons of individual unconnected innovations and helped us see that [[202105071301 - All technological innovations are connected]]. 
- The fact that different languages have words that don't exist in other languages (emotions are an interesting specific case)

## Context
- I came up with this in the context of [[The Wright Brothers by David]], who largely failed to build a powerhouse commercial entity out of their #Innovation, were yet the #Inventor of the innovation. 

## Idea
- This is more of a #Hypothesis than a fully formed idea. I'm basing this off of [[Titan The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.]], who developed a business around existing technologies well arrayed and made with #Efficiency. The Wright brothers were less successful even though they were the inventors. 
- This reminds me of the first movers advantage and makes me question if it is even real. It didn't work in [[Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson]] as he invented barely anything. Nor did it work with Microsoft either. #Inventions and commercial #Innovation seem to be 2 different things. 


## Questions
- What are other examples and counter examples? Has anyone done a comprehensive study on this?
- Has this changed over time? [[03062021 - The nature of invention has changed in the digital era]] - is this hypothesis true?
- Could the fact that [[03062021 - New inventions are almost always contested by traditionalists]] slow down the pace of the inventors? 
- Could it be a misalignment between resources (that inventors have less and thus can't capitalize) - [[03062021 - Too many resources can be as harmful as too few if they aren't the right kind]].

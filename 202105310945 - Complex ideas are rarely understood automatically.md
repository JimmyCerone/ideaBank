## Idea
- A complex idea requires processing and ultimately lots of representations plus [[041120211358 - Spaced Repetition]] to lock in. 

## Connections
- Reminds me of [[The Righteous Mind by Jonathon Haidt]] and why we get things wrong. We use simple shortcuts to understand complex topics, which is classic [[Thinking Fast and Slow]] now that I think about it. 

## Example
- My research with Dr. Shorb on the hypertext learning theory and multiple representations in textbooks tied with his research on experts. 
- Politics relies on this assumption being incorrect. The hope is that via quick soundbites, we can understand complicated topics.

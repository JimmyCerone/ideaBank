I think there is this perception that [[Brain Computer Interface]] are in the future, yet think about how much of our #Memory is already kept on #Computer because [[Humans have limited memories]]. Even paper is a device that extends the brain by allowing you to remember less. #Writing is another #Technology that extends the memory. I think that an article like [[Gabe Newel says brain computer interface tech will allow video games far beyond what human 'meat peripherals' can comprehend]] sounds radical, but when you think about what already exists it's not that crazy.

- We see #Learning wormholes as useless primarily because we don't persist any of that #Knowledge  in a web. We can't retrieve it. It's not connected, that's the real problem.

I've heard a few people at #AtomicObject break down #Knowledge / #Documentation as having a few components / #Levers:
- Time to Persist (Storage Time)
- Time to Retrieve (Access Time)

When framed like this, there are a few #Computer like levers to push on. 

How do you decrease your access time?
- #Obsidian 

How do you decrease your time to persist?
- #Siri (add a note)

The #Problem then becomes, how do I minimize the time it takes to make my knowledge connected (i.e. useful). 

It's kind of the inverse of [[03062021 - Solving a problem in independent parts, making uncorrelated bets, leads to success]], we want to tie up our knowledge to make use of our [[03092021 - Working Memory]].

## Context
The author is reflecting on his friend Mike's (a hypnotherapist) consultation with his patient and realizing that while he found it successful, he would have no way of knowing how everyone else in the room felt about it. The author notes that he's written a book on the subject, comparing his and his patient's reflections and compiling them into a book. 

## Idea
What we find important or useful in a conversation is often markedly different than what another finds. We literally live in different worlds, which reminds me of the article I wrote about the topic, [[How do you see the world]]. In that story, I called the our #Worldview a lens, but it's more comprehensive than that. It's more like a sea that we live in.

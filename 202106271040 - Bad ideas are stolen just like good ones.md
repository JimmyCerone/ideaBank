## Idea
- Bad ideas move quickly, which is in part why you have to be thoughtful about everything you share. Ideas are powerful, which means they are dangerous. 
	- I think we always assume that [[03132021 - The gospel of enterprise has been used for centuries to demean outsiders]] means that we live in an idea meritocracy, but the only thing ideas have in common is the ability to quickly spread (though good ideas requiring change are often slow to spread [[202106271039 - If your ideas are really, really good they might have a much harder time being stolen.]]). So in an odd way, many times the worst ideas spread the fastest because they require no change.


## Connections
- I wonder if bad ideas are like [[202105210024 - Habits spread like viruses]]?

## Example
- Racism, facism.

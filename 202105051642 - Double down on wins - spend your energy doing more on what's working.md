## Idea
- Kind of a corollary of [[202105051639 - We have solved most of our problems, just not in a consistent and distributed way]] and [[202105051633 - Finding bright spots motivates and directs change]]. I've heard this lots of places before, but has lots of implications given my focus on becoming future proof in light of [[202103291336 - The Episode of Everything - Balaji on Bitcoin]] and [[202105051730 - Kevin Kelly on the Tim Ferriss Show]].

## Example
- Double down on my love of future tech at work because people are liking it. Double down on articles at Idea Exploreres with [[Neil]] because it is really working.

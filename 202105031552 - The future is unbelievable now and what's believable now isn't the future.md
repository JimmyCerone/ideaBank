## Reflections
- The future is not something we can imagine so every correct prediction will sound insane.  - [[202103261112 - The future is inherently unpredictable]]
- Alternatively, what's believable now isn't the future, which has interesting implications for [[03072021 - The future is predicted and shaped by fiction]]

## Example
- Trouble coming up with these, though I guess planes from [[The Wright Brothers by David]] has some interesting ideas about it. HG Wells predicted the plane and its downside, even though the brothers didn't.

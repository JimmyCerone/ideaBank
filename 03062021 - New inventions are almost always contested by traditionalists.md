## Context
- I've come across this idea in many places and spaces, but I remembered it while reading about the reaction to bikes in [[The Wright Brothers by David]]. People said that bikes were morally hazardous, that kids would wander far from #Home with these new devices. They were said to take time away from #Books, which were ironically decried when they became popular as well. There was a #Sexual component as well, with some saying that country tours on bikes were, "not infrequently accompanied by seductions".

## Reflection
- Whenever something new comes along, it is a threat to the old older. Or is it? Is that why people react? It's hard for me to parse out why people react so adversely to new inventions, especially one as harmless as the #Bike. What's weird is that people have reacted the same way to #Books, #Movie s, and now #Phone s. #SocialMedia is facing the same backlash now. 

## Questions
- Do these backlashes ever stop the invention from coming to be?
	- The electric car has had severe backlashes as well as Tesla, but those weren't public outcries as far as I know. Mostly led by private companies. 
- Who stood to lose from the invention of the bike? Was it parents who lost control of their kids? Was it that it was democratizing?

## Context
- I came across this idea in [[Shoot Me While I'm Happy - Memories from the Tap Goddess of the Lower East Side by Jane Goldberg]], which talks about #Tap #Dance, which has a #History that is passed down #Orally. I'm fascinated by oral history, ever since I learned about the writing of the #Bible and later when I learned about #Lakota history. 


## Connections
- The complicated part about oral history is that [[Shared realities with different interpretations]] exist. The history is everyone's perceptions combined. All history is like this, but there is some weird definition that considers history to be done by historians alone. We are all historians, really. It's funny that we trust history books so much when [[03042021 - Books are surprisingly bad at conveying knowledge, and readers mostly donâ€™t realize it.]]. Why don't we realize this? Why do we hold to written history as the gospel truth? The practice of history is complicated by the twin facts that [[You can write about things you don't understand yet]] and [[03042021 - You can think you understand something without ever "getting it"]]. Is there any way to test your understanding? Tough to know and fascinating to imagine a world in which history was less a single source of truth and more a #Distribution across many people, almost like the Coherent Extrapolated Vision from [[Superintelligence]].

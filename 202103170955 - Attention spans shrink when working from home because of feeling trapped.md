My pet theory is that my attention span has shrunk while #WFH because you can't leave meetings. I'm oddly trapped in meetings all day and it's absolutely exhausting. I think a short attention span is a coping mechanism.

- I think I this idea connects quite nicely with my attention span theory [[202103171015 - Humans feel alonely when they don't get enough alone time]]
- Perfect example of how [[03102021 - Not all tech is helpful]]. Being hyperconnected all the time is detrimental. #WFH is both lonely and alonely because you are simultaneously always "on" and yet always alone. 
- I also think [[Will to Meaning vs Pleasure]] plays a role here. It's a pet theory, but I think we need physical progress to feel meaning and without it, we get stuck seeking pleasure in the form of quick dopamine hits.

As Paula Gunn Allen in [[The Sacred Hoop by Paula Gunn Allen]] and others argue, #America is an Indian project. The #Ideas of many tribes, including the Iroquois, influenced how we run our #Government. The same happened in [[King Leopold's Ghost]], when #Europe's #Art was revolutionized by the #Cubism that already existed their. The #Appropriation of #Ideas was just as bad as the appropriation of #Physical goods.

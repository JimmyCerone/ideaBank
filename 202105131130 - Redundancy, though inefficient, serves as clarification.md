## Idea
- This is due in part because [[202104120847 - Words aren't well defined]] and [[Mind communicates in images but we speak in words]]. The redundancy in a language helps make it more clear what's going on. Computers do this as well, because some information is lost. 

## Example
- Drums in the Kele tribe that use only tones and add context by saying, "The moon looks down on the earth" instead of simply the moon

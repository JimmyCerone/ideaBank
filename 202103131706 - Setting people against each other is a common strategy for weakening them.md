## Context
- In both [[King Leopold's Ghost]] and [[The Heart of Everything That Is]], #Indigenous #Tribes were set against each other to weaken them. This also happened in the War of 1812... [[Burn Notice]] talked about this in one of the episodes as well. 

## Reflection
- This is exactly what #Russia and other countries are trying to do to #America. We may get so lost fighting each other that we forget everyone else.

#Spin 

## Context
- Kim recommended this article as part of her ongoing #Design series at #AtomicObject 

## Reflections
- I feel like this is such an effective strategy that I rarely think to utilize. I think when explaining #Levers the story component would be really useful to refine. 
- I think this is yet another think that [[Neil]] and I could improve upon in our work. 


## Connections
- Once again, I see this concept connecting to [[Shared realities with different interpretations]] because stories are like metaphors, they are an attempt at communicating our reality through words translated from images.

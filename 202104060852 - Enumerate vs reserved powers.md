In a federal #Government, the federal government has [[202104060850 - Enumerated powers]] which are explicitly granted and the states get everything else that goes unmentioned as [[202104060851 - Reserved powers]]. In an interesting twist, there is some overlap in these powers. Both federal and state levels get: 
- Right to levy taxes
- Chief executive (gov and pres)
- System of courts
- Legislatures

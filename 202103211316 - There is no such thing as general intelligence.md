## Context
- Learned this while listening to [[202103181651 - The Quiet Master of Cryptocurrency]], in a point made by Naval about why the #Singularity is exceedingly unlikely. 

## Idea
- Naval's claim that #Intelligence cannot be general blew my mind. #Human s are not even generally intelligent. There are so many fields we are uncapable of learning (smelling like a dog, for example). His point is that intelligence is more about adaptation to environment. 

## Connections
- The point was in light of [[202103181938 - Pascal's Scam]]. 
- Intelligence is limited by environment - [[202103211307 - Machine learning faces the same limits as human learning - environment is everything]].

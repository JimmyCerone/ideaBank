## Idea
- Agreement and disagreement are not two opposite poles. In reality, this is a ternary where the options are: 
	- Agree
	- Disagree
	- No opinion
- No opinion throws a wrench in the binary nature because it is not necessarily the midpoint of agreement and disagreement because you can have no opinion for a variety of reasons. 
	- You can have no opinion because:
		- You've never heard of something ([[202105071351 - Adjacent Possible]])
		- You don't care at all
		- You have no direct experience
- Additionally, agreement and disagreement are not evenly distributed across a topic. 
	- You can agree with parts and disagree with other parts of an agreement, all to different degrees. What we take as "agreement" is that the local maxima of someone's agreement is in line with one side of the topic
## Connections
- Yet another of uneven distributions that people simplify into polarities (see politics in [[Why We're Polarized by Ezra Klein]]) [[202104070856 - The future is already here, it's just not evenly distributed]] and [[202105051639 - We have solved most of our problems, just not in a consistent and distributed way]] and [[202104081532 - Value as a consultant is unevenly distributed]]
- I think part of the reason agreement and disagreement are not binary is because [[202103261111 - Humans are terrible predictors]] and [[202105031552 - The future is unbelievable now and what's believable now isn't the future]]. We just don't know whether we agree with some things or not even though we think we do. 

## Example
- My brother's take on [[03292021 - Cancel Culture]] in [[202103291355 - Cancelling Cancel Culture]].

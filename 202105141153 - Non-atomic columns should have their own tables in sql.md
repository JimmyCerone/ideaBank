## Idea
- Each table in #SQL should contain atomic columns. If a column isn't #Atomic it should be made into a table. 

## Example
- Interests in Greg's list for dating in head first book.

## Questions
- How could this apply to other areas? How could it apply to my brain? [[Neil]]'s idea about articles?

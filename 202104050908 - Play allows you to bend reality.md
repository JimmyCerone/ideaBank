Play can be #Healing and help your #MentalHealth. I'm reminded that [[Waking the Tiger]] is in some ways about play - allowing your imagination to find a new way out of old terrors. 

Play also has a place in #Eroticism as it createst he space for carefree and unself-conscious expression. 

What I find fascinating is that #Play is not #Efficiency. So to play, you have to let go of that. I think that's at the root of my struggles (which required [[Limit my consumption of books and articles]]). When I start to try to optimize, I lose myself because I lose my ability to play. 

A corollary here is that fantasy is play and has a place in #Eroticism. Fantasy is not about reality at all. Fantasizing about someone does not mean you want to leave your partner, it is more like a dream, where things are loosely and strangely connected to reality.

## Context
- Thought through this #Idea while reading [[Titan The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.]], [[Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World]], and [[The Wright Brothers by David]]. 

## Idea
- In the first two cases, the #Wealth did end up leading to luxury. Rockefeller kind of got addicted to nice things, building many houses even as he gave away tons and tons of #Money. He was still frugal and kept a tight grip on his cash, but ended up being rather extravagant in the end even as he said he wasn't. Genghis Kahn himself didn't end up loving #Luxury, but his people did and he was stuck in a constant cycle of conquering because of the acquisition of a new luxurious lifestyle. 

## Connections
- In [[King Leopold's Ghost]], Leopold lusted after a #Colony for the wealth. When he got it, he spent lavishly. So lavishly that his own people realized he wasn't poor anymore and got pissed. 

## Counterpoint
- The Wright brothers seem to be a counterpoint, though Wilbur died before they were really #Rich. Orville did end up building a nice big #Home but that seemed to be the extent of his extravagance, though they did have modest means compared to the two mentioned above. 
	- Well. I'm revising this. Orville bought his family an #Island and they did end up going on some very nice vacations. 
	- In total, they were "only" worth like $10 million by the time of their #Death, very different than the two above. So perhaps not a great comparison. 
	> Orville thought it fair to say he was well-to-do, rather than wealthy, and loved to quote his father: "All the money anyone needs is just enough to prevent one from being a burden to others."
